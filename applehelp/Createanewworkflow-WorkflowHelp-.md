## Create a new workflow

It’s easy to create a new, custom workflow.

1.  In the My Workflows screen, do one of the following:
    
    -   Tap the + button in the upper-right corner.
        
    -   Tap Create Workflow at the end of your list of workflows.
        
    
    An empty, untitled workflow appears in the workflow composer. In the following image, an empty workflow composer is displayed on an iPhone.

2.  From the horizontal list at the top of the screen, select the type of workflow you want to build:
    
    -   *Normal:* Creates a workflow that you launch from the Workflow app. This is the default workflow type.
        
    -   *Today Widget:* Creates a workflow that you launch from a widget in iOS Today View. For details, see [Set up and run workflows in Today View](https://help.apple.com/workflow/#/apda11a05448).
        
    -   *Apple Watch:* Creates a workflow that you launch from an Apple Watch. For details, see [About Workflow on Apple Watch](https://help.apple.com/workflow/#/apdbe2ceb96c).
        
    -   *Action Extension:* Creates a workflow that you launch from an app other than Workflow. For details, see [Set up and run workflows from another app](https://help.apple.com/workflow/#/apd163eb9f95).
        
3.  Do one of the following:
    
    -   *On an iPhone:* Tap the Actions button at the bottom of the screen (the magic wand); when the list appears, drag an action to the right, releasing the action when it appears in the workflow composer.
        
        **Tip:** You can also swipe left to display the Actions list.
        
    -   *On an iPad or iPhone Plus:* Drag an action from left sidebar into the workflow area to the right.
        
        ![An action being dragged from the Actions sidebar to the workflow area](https://help.apple.com/workflow/en.lproj/Art/S0086_DraggingiPad.png)
        
        For more information about choosing actions, see [Navigate the Actions list](https://help.apple.com/workflow/#/apdc33e4f4da).
        
4.  Repeat step 3 for each action you want to add to your custom workflow.
    
    **Tip:** You can change the order of actions by dragging one or more actions to a different location in the workflow list.
    
5.  To give the workflow a custom name, tap ![](https://help.apple.com/workflow/en.lproj/GlobalArt/IL_Gear.png) to open Settings, then tap the Name row, tap the remove button (x), type a new name, and tap Done.
    
6.  To customize this workflow’s activation button, click the Icon row and choose a new color, glyph, or custom photo, then tap Done.
    
    *Note:* If you don’t see the Icon row, click ![](https://help.apple.com/workflow/en.lproj/GlobalArt/IL_Gear.png) to open Settings.
    
7.  Tap Done again to return to the workflow composer.

    To stop the workflow, tap ![](https://help.apple.com/workflow/en.lproj/GlobalArt/IL_Stop.png).
    
9.  To save your new workflow, click Done.
    

The new workflow appears at the bottom of your list of workflows on the My Workflows screen, ready for use.
