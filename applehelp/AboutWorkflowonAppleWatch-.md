Workflow comes bundled with an Apple Watch app that lets you run workflows from your wrist. Workflows on your iPhone automatically sync with Apple Watch, and you can decide which workflows you’d like to show on your watch.

Workflow for Apple Watch supports a wide variety of tasks, including dictating or scribbling text, picking contacts and dates, fetching from the web, sharing, and more—all from the watch itself. For parts of a workflow that aren’t supported on the watch, the Workflow app silently runs actions in the background on your iPhone, or finishes the job on your iPhone.

Workflow for Apple Watch also comes with a complication for launching workflows from your watch face. When it’s set up, you just raise your wrist and tap to run.
