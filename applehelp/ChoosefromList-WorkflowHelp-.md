## Choose from List

Use the Choose from List action to narrow down a list of items. Choose from List presents a list of the items that were passed as input, and allows you to select one or more of these items to pass to the next action. For example, you could use the Get Upcoming Events action to grab 15 of your upcoming calendar events, then use the Choose from List action to grab a specific event.

Choose from List shows rich previews of the items as they’re displayed in the menu. For example, passing iTunes items into Choose from List displays the artist, album artwork, and track length, in addition to the song title.

**Tip:** If you use the Set Name action on content items and then pass them into Choose from List, the custom name you’ve set is shown in the menu rather than the default name.

If you use Choose from List on a dictionary item, the menu displays all of the keys in the dictionary, and for each key you select, the corresponding values are passed as output.

## Add a Choose from List action to a workflow

## Allow selection of multiple items from the list

The output of the Choose from List action is available as a [Magic Variable](https://help.apple.com/workflow/#/apdd2b316022), so that the content you choose can be used later, and multiple times, throughout your workflow.
