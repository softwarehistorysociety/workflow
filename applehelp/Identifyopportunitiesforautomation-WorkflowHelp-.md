## Identify opportunities for automation

To identify what tasks to automate using workflows, observe how you use your iPhone, iPad, and Mac throughout the day. It’s obvious that tasks you do multiple times a day are ideal workflow candidates. However, there are many more opportunities: What task is taking too long? What can’t you do in the app you’re currently working in? What’s just too much trouble to bother with? You’ll start to recognize these moments as opportunities to create workflows (especially once you’ve reviewed the actions available in the Workflow app).

Consider the following:

-   *If you’re a student:* Create workflows to manage homework and exam reminders, study with flashcards, generate example problems, or translate text between languages.
    
-   *If you commute daily:* Create workflows to see transit times, review your meetings for the day, or hear top news headlines read aloud.
    
-   *If you’re health-conscious:* Create workflows for logging what you eat and drink, your exercise activity, your sleep, or your reproductive health; you can also create workflows to analyze your Health data and draw conclusions.
    
-   *If you’re an avid music listener:* Create workflows to add songs to playlists, pull up lyrics, share your favorite songs, or look up how to play a song.
    
-   *If you love eating out, grabbing coffee, or visiting pubs:* Create workflows to find directions to nearby venues, invite friends along, place orders over the phone, or log your opinions.
    
-   *If you often communicate with friends and loved ones:* Create workflows to send templated text messages, to edit your photos, to quickly place phone or FaceTime calls, or to create and share GIFs.
    
-   *If you share expenses with friends:* Create workflows to send or request payments over Venmo or another cash app.

Tasks that involve too many taps on your iOS device are also ideal candidates for workflows. Truly useful automations significantly reduce the number of taps that are required to reach your goal.

On iOS, most actions operate individually on links and documents, so passing multiple items into a workflow and acting on them simultaneously saves a lot of taps. For example, you could extract all the links from a webpage and add them to your Reading List rather than adding each link manually, one at a time.

A third-party app that doesn’t quite meet your needs is another ideal candidate for automation. By building a workflow that integrates with the third-party app, you're not confined to the choices offered by the app developers and you can create a more personalized tool.
