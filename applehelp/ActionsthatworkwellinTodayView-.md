Workflows with simple actions work best in Today View. The following actions are good candidates for workflows that can be launched and completed entirely within Today View.

## Ask for Input

Use the Ask for Input action to enter numbers in workflows in Today View. For example, you could use Ask for Input with the Log Health Sample action to create a widget workflow for logging your weight. When run, the workflow opens a number pad in the widget for typing in your weight.

When you add an Ask for Input action to your workflow, be sure to set Input Type to Number.

## Get Clipboard

Use the Get Clipboard action bring content into a workflow in Today View. When apps don’t provide the ability to share, you can copy what you want to the clipboard, and then run a workflow in Today View to process the content or send it somewhere else.

For example, the Save Input as Trello Note takes a shared item or clipboard and adds it to Trello as a note.

And the Save Notes to Dropbox workflow uses the Get Clipboard action to add copied content to Dropbox. Using this workflow from Today View, you can send multiple passages from one or more documents to Dropbox, appending each piece of copied information to the same Dropbox file.

## Choose from List, Choose from Menu

Use the Choose from List and Choose from Menu actions make selections from a list of options in Today View. Right from the widget, you can make choices that change how the workflow operates.

For example, using the Choose from List action, you can set up a workflow that displays a list of songs to play. A more complicated workflow might use the Choose from Menu action to branch the workflow and run a series of actions based on the option chosen.

## Show Alert

Use the Show Alert action to display alerts or to ask for a confirmation in Today View. When a workflow reaches an alert, a message with an OK button (and sometimes a Cancel button) is displayed.
