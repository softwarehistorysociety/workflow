## List

Use the List action to create an ordered list of content, by entering text or by inserting [variables](https://help.apple.com/workflow/#/apdd02c2780c). When the workflow is run, the contents of List are passed into the next action. If you pass a List into a Quick Look action, you can preview each item in the list one at a time.

For example, List might work as a simple menu of choices for filling out a text field (such as “Dear Sir/Madam,”) or as a series of album titles to choose from.

The List action can also hold variables. For example, you can use the List action to group multiple types of content together, such as a file, a photo, and a location. Then you can pass that List into another action or use those items later.

If a variable is added within a text string in the List action, the variable is forced into text and is inserted into the List item.

Arranging variables in a List action is similar to manually adding variables one at a time using the Add to Variable action.

## Add a List action to a workflow

In the workflow composer, do one of the following:

-   *Add a List action on iPhone:* Tap Actions (the magic wand), drag the List action (from the Scripting category in the Actions list) to the right, then position the action in the workflow.
    
-   *Add a List action on iPad:* Drag the List action (from the Scripting category in the Actions list) into position in the workflow.
