## Ask When Run variable

The Ask When Run variable allows you to adjust the parameters of an action at runtime. Using the Ask When Run variable, you can wait to decide how an action should operate until the workflow is run.

As your workflow runs, each action is completed until it reaches an action that contains an Ask When Run variable. The workflow pauses, prompting you to update the action’s parameters. Once you tap Done, the workflow continues its run.

To add the Ask When Run variable to a parameter, tap the empty space in the action around the parameter name, then tap Ask When Run. Now, each time the workflow runs, you're asked to confirm your option for that parameter. To insert an Ask When Run variable in actions with text fields, tap the text field, then tap Ask When Run (in the variable bar that appears above the keyboard).

Using the Ask When Run variable on a parameter can be helpful for adjusting options on the fly, such as the option to Show Compose Sheet in the Send Email action.
