Most services require you to sign up for their API, after which you're assigned a “secret key” that grants you access. This key is included as part of the API request, letting the service know who’s making the API request—this key is unique to you and should not be shared with anyone else.

You can sign up for a Dark Sky account [here](https://darksky.net/dev).

Once you have your secret key, you’re ready to make your first API request.
