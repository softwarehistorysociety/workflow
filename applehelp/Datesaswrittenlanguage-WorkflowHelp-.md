## Dates as written language

The How Long Ago/Until format is useful for gathering a simple description of how long ago or how far into the future a date is relative to now. The result is based on the most significant component of the time period, producing results like `43 minutes ago`, `19 hours from now`, `5 days from now`, or `3 months ago`.

Similarly, the Relative date format allows you to choose from helpful shortcuts such as Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow. These options are relative to the current date and time when the workflow is run.
