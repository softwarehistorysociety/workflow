## Share workflows

You can share your workflows in several ways:

-   Create a link that allows a recipient to download a copy of your workflow. If the Workflow app is installed on the recipient’s device, tapping the link opens the Workflow app and displays a preview of the workflow. If the Workflow app is not installed on the recipient’s device, tapping the link displays a webpage that displays a summary of the workflow.
    
    *Note:* Sharing a workflow by creating a link uploads the workflow to a private location on the Workflow website. Although uploaded workflows are not indexed or searchable by the public, anyone with a link can download and use the workflow. Please see the Workflow [privacy policy](http://workflow.is/privacy) for more details.
    
-   Share a workflow to the Home Screen of your iOS device. This allows you to run a workflow from your Home Screen without opening the Workflow app.
    
-   Share a workflow as a file, so it can be imported locally without an Internet connection. This can be useful for sharing via email, or for backing up a workflow externally in a third-party app.
    
    *Note:* The Share as File option does not upload a copy of your workflow to the Workflow website, and is recommended for sharing workflows that contain personal information.
    
-   Duplicate a workflow, creating a copy of the original workflow.

2.  Do one of the following:
    
    -   *Create a private link to your workflow and share the URL:* Tap Copy Link or another sharing activity, such as Message or Mail.
        
    -   *Share the workflow to your Home screen:* Tap Add to Home Screen.

    -   *Share your workflow as a .wflow file:* Tap Share as File, then tap an option, such as Mail or Save to Files.
        
        The .wflow file contains information about your workflow, such as its actions and the order of the actions, so it can be imported locally without an Internet connection. This is useful for sharing via email or for backing up a workflow externally in a third-party app.
        
    -   *Duplicate a workflow:* Tap Duplicate Workflow.
        
        The copied workflow appears in the My Workflows screen.
