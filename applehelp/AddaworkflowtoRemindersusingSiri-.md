You can use Siri to add workflows to the Reminders app, specifying workflows to be shown at a particular time or location. For example, you can schedule a reminder to run the Log Weight workflow each morning, or to display the Home workflow when you depart from work.

-   In Workflow, open a workflow, then do one of the following:
    
    -   Say “Hey Siri, remind me about this.”
        
    -   Hold down the Home button, then say “Remind me about this.”
        
        *Note:* You can also use alternate Siri commands, such as “Add this to my Work list” or “Remind me about this Saturday at 2 p.m.”
        
    
    Siri understands that you’re looking at a workflow and creates the reminder.

    The workflow is added to your default Reminders list. The name of the workflow is the title of the reminder, and the number of actions is listed below the date and time.
