## What is Workflow?

Workflow is an app that lets you create powerful task automations on iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch without requiring familiarity with programming. Workflow provides hundreds of actions that interact with the apps and content on your device.

## What’s a workflow?

A workflow is a series of actions that accomplish a particular task. Workflows simplify everyday tasks by combining many steps—even across multiple apps—into a single tap.

Workflows can automate a wide variety of things—for example, getting directions to the next event on your calendar, moving text from one app to another, generating expense reports, and more.

## What’s an action?

An action is the building block of a workflow. Each workflow is made up of a series of actions, and each action is a single step that performs a particular function. For example, Get Latest Photos lets you view the latest photos that you took on your device; Make GIF makes an animated GIF out of a series of photos; and Tweet automatically posts the content that you select to Twitter.

Actions represent the best features of the apps on your device, broken out into smaller parts. With more than 300 actions, there are a variety of individual steps you can chain together to build out your workflows. Here are some example chains of actions you might include in a workflow:

-   Get Latest Photos + Edit Image + Send Message

-   Get Upcoming Events + Get Addresses from Input + Search Local Businesses + Show in Maps

When you run a workflow, each action runs in sequence from the first action to the last action. By arranging actions that perform individual tasks together in specific ways, you can define how a workflow acts as it progresses through each step. Actions are the core building blocks of workflows, so the actions you choose and their order are key to making workflows suited to your needs.

## Where are workflows stored?

Workflows you create or download are located in the My Workflows section of the app. These workflows are available on your device, ready to run at a moment’s notice.

Each workflow is represented by a rounded rectangle that has a title, an icon, and a color. Tap a workflow once to open it and see the actions contained inside.
