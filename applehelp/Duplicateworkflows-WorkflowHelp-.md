## Duplicate workflows

You can quickly make a copy of a workflow, making it easy to use an existing workflow as the springboard for creating a new workflow.

## Duplicate a workflow

1.  In the My Workflows screen, touch and hold any workflow icon until the icons jiggle.
    
    In edit mode, the Rename, Duplicate, and Remove buttons become available in the top-right corner.

2.  Tap one or more workflow icons (the icon colors darken to indicate selection), then tap the Duplicate button \[+\].
    
    A copy of the selected workflow is created.
    
    *Note:* New workflows are also added to any device signed in with your [Workflow Sync account](https://help.apple.com/workflow/#/apd82e4718d2).
