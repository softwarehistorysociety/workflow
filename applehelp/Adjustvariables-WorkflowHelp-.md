## Adjust variables

Variables are powerful not only because they let you reuse content, but also because they let you store or extract rich metadata about that content.

## Edit a variable

## Change a variable’s content type

## Choose a variable’s content details

## Rename a variable

## Reveal the action that generated the variable

Once you’ve grasped how to add, place, and adjust variables, you’ll begin to see how variables make your workflows much more dynamic. You can reuse content multiple times, easily extract particular details from the content, and place that content anywhere in your workflow.

Variables let you make workflows that are capable of adapting to a variety of situations, adjusting content on the fly while still yielding the results you want.

**Tip:** If you’re just getting started with variables, it may be helpful to experiment with an existing workflow that includes variables. Download a workflow from the Gallery, then reorder the actions or add new variables to see how it affects the workflow.
