## Transform actions

*Transform actions* edit content (such as cropping an image) or convert content to a different format (such as changing a PNG to a JPEG). Using the [Content Graph engine](https://help.apple.com/workflow/#/apda4856024a), Workflow often automatically converts content that’s passed between actions; however, you can use transform actions for more control over the conversions.

As you build your workflow, you can [search for transform actions](https://help.apple.com/workflow/#/apdc33e4f4da?sub=apd4287f86d0) using keywords like *make*, *filter*, *convert*, *edit*, *get*, and *adjust*. For example, you might want to use Filter Images by Orientation to separate out portrait photos, or use Make Rich Text from HTML on a link from Safari.

In the following image, a search using the keyword “Convert” displays actions that perform conversion tasks.

Other helpful transform actions include Combine Text, Combine Images, Translate Text, Detect Language, Filter Event Attendees, and Filter Files.
