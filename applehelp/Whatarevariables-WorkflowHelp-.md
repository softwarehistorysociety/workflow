## What are variables?

A variable is a container used to label and store content such as text, images, a web page, or a dictionary of data.

When you create a workflow using variables, actions in the workflow aren’t required to follow a direct linear path of inputs and outputs—content can weave in and out of the workflow at different points. For instance, the workflow can store content at a certain point, perform an entirely independent set of actions, and then grab the original content in subsequent steps.

Using variables is the most powerful way to expand the capability of your workflows, allowing you to set up dynamic templates for content that autofill each time you use the workflow. When a workflow runs through its sequence of actions, it looks for any variables, retrieves the appropriate content for each variable, and then places the content inline, producing consistent results.

In Workflow, variables are represented by a small tokens, such as ![](https://help.apple.com/workflow/en.lproj/Art/S0204_VariablesTokenText.png), ![](https://help.apple.com/workflow/en.lproj/Art/S0202_VariablesTokenAskWhenRun.png), or ![](https://help.apple.com/workflow/en.lproj/Art/S0203_VariablesTokenClipboard.png). You place variables throughout the workflow to mark where you want to set and retrieve content each time the workflow is run.
