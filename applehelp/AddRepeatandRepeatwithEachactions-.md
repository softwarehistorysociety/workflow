Workflow offers two actions for creating repeat loops: Repeat and Repeat with Each. A repeat loop is when a group of actions runs multiple times.

## Add a Repeat or Repeat with Each action to a workflow

Do one of the following:

-   *To add a Repeat or Repeat with Each action on iPhone:* Tap Actions (the magic wand), drag the Repeat or Repeat with Each action (from the Scripting category in the Actions list) to the right, then position the action in the workflow.
    

-   *To add a Repeat or Repeat with Each action on iPad:* Drag the Repeat or Repeat with Each action (from the Scripting category in the Actions list) into the workflow.
    

For more information about working with the Repeat action and the Repeat with Each action, see [About Repeat actions](https://help.apple.com/workflow/#/apdc11deb2c1).
