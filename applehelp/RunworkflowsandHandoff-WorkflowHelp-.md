## Run workflows and Handoff

Many workflows can run entirely on Apple Watch. The app supports a variety of tasks directly from your wrist, including (but not limited to):

-   Dictating or scribbling text
    
-   Picking contacts, photos, music, or dates
    
-   Fetching information from the internet
    
-   Sharing and sending emails and text messages
    
-   Recording audio clips
    
-   Getting Maps directions
    
-   Logging data to the Health app
    
-   Presenting alerts, menus, and lists
    
-   Using Ask When Run and variables
    
-   Working with many third-party services
    

Workflows that work well on the Apple Watch are usually quick interactions that require only a few taps, like logging how much water you drank or entering a short reminder.

Workflows that don’t require any interaction also work well on Apple Watch, such as saving music to new playlists or even using Get Contents of URL to make an API call.

The Apple Watch is especially great for displaying alerts that you can quickly glance at on your wrist.

Due to limited screen space on the Apple Watch, however, not all workflows are capable of running entirely on the watch. If an action requires a special interface or requires too much memory, you may need to use Handoff to send the workflow to the paired iPhone.

When an action can’t run on the watch, you’ll be prompted to swipe up on the Handoff icon in the bottom left corner of your iPhone Lock screen to finish running the workflow on your iPhone.

Alternatively, you can unlock the phone and open the App Switcher by double-clicking the home button. A bar appears at the bottom of the screen to open Workflow via Handoff.

Once you’ve set a workflow’s type to Apple Watch, any actions that won’t work entirely on the watch will be updated to show that they require Handoff.

When you open the Actions list, you’ll see icons for actions that require the Handoff feature there, as well.
