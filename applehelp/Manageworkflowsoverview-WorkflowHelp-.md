## Manage workflows overview

As you build your workflow collection, there are a number of ways you can organize and manage workflows. You can:

-   [Order workflows](https://help.apple.com/workflow/#/apd052072d68) so that your most-used ones appear first in the Workflow app, in iOS Today View, or on Apple Watch
    
-   Quickly [duplicate a workflow](https://help.apple.com/workflow/#/apd6b467942c) for use as the starting point of a new workflow
    
-   [Delete a workflow](https://help.apple.com/workflow/#/apd096cd65c6) you no longer need
    
-   [Sync workflows](https://help.apple.com/workflow/#/apd82e4718d2) between all of your iOS devices so that, for example, workflows you create on your iPhone automatically appear on your iPad
    
-   [Share workflows](https://help.apple.com/workflow/#/apdf01f8c054), as well as customize a shared workflow’s information so that no personal data is shared
