## How do workflows work?

When you run a workflow, each action in the list of actions runs in order from top to bottom. Each action plays a role in the task or goal you want to accomplish, much like individual steps in a factory assembly line. For example, some actions fetch information—either from your device or from the Internet. Some actions transform information—say, for resizing an image. Other actions share information to services like Facebook or Twitter.

Once the last action finishes running, the workflow completes.
