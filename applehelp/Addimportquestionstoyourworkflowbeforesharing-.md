If your workflow includes steps that contain personal information, such as addresses, contacts, phone numbers, or the name of a playlist, you can add import questions to those specific fields of the workflow. If an import question is present for a field, your personal information is not shared—that field is cleared when the workflow is shared. When the recipient downloads the workflow, he or she is presented with the import questions. When the questions are answered, the workflow is populated with the user’s own information.

For example, the Home ETA workflow (available in the Gallery) includes an import question that asks, “What is your home address?”

    You can add as many import questions as needed, and each question is asked in order when the workflow is imported.
    
6.  *Optional:* Enter an answer in the Default Answer field.
    
7.  Tap Done, tap Questions, tap Settings, then tap Done.
    
    **Tip:** Once you’ve added Import Questions, you can test the questions: Repeat step 1 above, tap Customize Workflow, then run through each import question, ensuring each makes sense and works as intended. Keep in mind that answers you provide overwrite the previous configuration.
