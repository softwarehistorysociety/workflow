## Show Alert

The Show Alert action allows you to present an arbitrary dialog with a title, a description, an OK button (to continue the workflow run), and an optional Cancel button (to stop the workflow run). Use Show Alert to share information with the user, provide warning messages, pause the workflow at a specific point, and so on.

Show Alert is especially useful for displaying information in iOS Today View or on Apple Watch. For example, you can create a workflow that determines sunrise and sunset times and displays an alert that includes a summary.

You can also use the Show Alert action to debug workflows when you’re not getting your intended workflow result. By passing content into Show Alert, you can preview the output of the previous action at a certain point in a workflow, then cancel the workflow, if necessary.
