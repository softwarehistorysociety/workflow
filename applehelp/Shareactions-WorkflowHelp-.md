## Share actions

After get actions bring content into the workflow and transform actions modify that content, *share actions* send your content to a new place. Share actions comprise the largest group of actions in Workflow and include a variety of integrations with other apps and services that widen the capabilities of your workflows. These actions are commonly used near the end of a workflow to pass the content out and into another app as the final step in accomplishing your goal.

The most straightforward sharing actions are Share and Share with Extensions.

As you build your workflow, you can [search for share actions](https://help.apple.com/workflow/#/apdc33e4f4da?sub=apd4287f86d0) using keywords like *add*, *create*, *post*, *share*, *send*, and *log* for making new items, *save* and *append* for working with files, and *open* for launching other apps.

## Share actions for adding new items

Many share actions in the Workflow app let you add or create items in other apps, including Add New Reminder, Add New Event, Add to Playlist, Add to Reading List, Add to Instapaper, Add Trello Card, Add OmniFocus Item, and Add Due Reminder.

Share actions create new items in their respective apps, such as Create Playlist, Create Note (in Notes), Create New Note (in Evernote), Create Trello List, and Create Folder in Dropbox.

Some share actions are used for posting content, including Tweet, Post to Facebook, Post on Instagram, Post to WordPress, and Post to Slack.

And some actions are used for logging data, including Log Health Sample and Log Workout.

## Share actions for file management

File-related share actions include Save File, Save to Photo Album, Save to OneDrive, and Share on Slack.

## Share actions for launching content in another app

Share actions that launch content in another app include Open URLs, Open App, Open In, Open Ulysses, Open Bear Note, and Open Draft. You can [search for these share actions](https://help.apple.com/workflow/#/apdc33e4f4da?sub=apd4287f86d0) using the keyword, *open*.

For example, Open URLs takes any links passed as input and opens them in Safari. Open URLs also supports URL schemes provided by other apps you have installed. Learn more in [Using another app’s URL scheme](https://help.apple.com/workflow/#/apd68802640c).

The Open In action sends a copy of your work to another app that supports documents. Perhaps you want your workflow to fetch a webpage, convert it from HTML to Rich Text, and then send it to Pages or Microsoft Word. Open in iBooks is similarly useful for saving PDFs or eBooks in iBooks.
