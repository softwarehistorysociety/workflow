## Organize workflows

In addition to adding and organizing workflows in the Workflow app, you can determine which workflows appear in the Workflow widget in Today View on iPhone or iPad, and on Apple Watch. Workflows appear in the same order on iOS devices and on Apple Watch as they do in the Workflow app (in the My Workflows and Settings screens).
