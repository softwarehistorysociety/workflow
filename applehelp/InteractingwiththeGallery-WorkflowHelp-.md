## Interacting with the Gallery

Workflow offers two URL scheme options for interacting with the Gallery: One for opening the Gallery, and one for searching the Gallery.

The URL to open the Gallery is `workflow://gallery`, taking you to the main page of the Gallery.

A URL to search the Gallery takes the following structure, where query determines the URL-encoded keywords to be searched in the Gallery:

`workflow://gallery/search?query=[query]`

For example, if you want to send someone a link to explore Evernote workflows available in the Gallery, you would instruct them to open:

`workflow://gallery/search?query=Evernote`
