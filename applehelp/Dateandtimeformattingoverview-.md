Taking control of your calendar and the date information included in your events is a powerful way to use Workflow. While building workflows, you may encounter situations where you want to format a date into text. Workflow offers a Format Date action for this purpose. Additionally, date and time formatting can be set within a variable.

The following sections discuss the date and time formatting options available in Workflow. It may be helpful to download [this sample workflow](https://workflow.is/workflows/b826e3e3324643688c58447360e20f6b) and experiment with the different date formats as you review the information.
