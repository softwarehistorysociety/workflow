## Web API overview

You can take your workflows to a whole new level by taking advantage of the power of *web APIs* (application programming interfaces).

Although most Workflow actions fill potential gaps between iOS apps, you may find a gap between one of your apps and the web service that powers that app. For example, you may want to retrieve and work with more raw data than an app discloses. As another example, you may want to automate saving or posting of information to a service—or perhaps a service doesn’t offer a mobile app but does offer an API. In such cases (and many more), you can use Workflow to perform an API request.

The following two sections, “Get started with web APIs” and “Work with JSON,” discuss obtaining and modifying a [Dark Sky](https://darksky.net/) weather API to build a workflow that displays the weather forecast.
