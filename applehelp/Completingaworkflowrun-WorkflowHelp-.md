## Completing a workflow run

When a workflow completes its chain of actions, an output is produced and appears in a window below the actions. Tap the Expand button to view content in full screen, or tap the Share button to send it elsewhere.

*Note:* If you run a workflow from the [Today Widget](https://help.apple.com/workflow/#/apda11a05448) or [Action Extension](https://help.apple.com/workflow/#/apd163eb9f95), no preview of the output is shown. Instead, the workflow is dismissed and you're returned to where you left off.
