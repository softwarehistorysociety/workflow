## Sync workflows

Using the Workflow Sync setting, you can keep your library of workflows up to date on all of your iOS devices. When you add, change, or remove a workflow from one of your devices, Workflow Sync ensures that the changes are reflected on your other devices automatically.

**Important:** [A Workflow account](https://help.apple.com/workflow/#/apd82e4718d2?sub=apdb2cae3107) is required to use the Workflow Sync feature.

Using the Sync Workflow Order option, the order of your workflows is also kept updated between all of your iOS devices.
