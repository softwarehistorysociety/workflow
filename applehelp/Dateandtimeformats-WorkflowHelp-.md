## Date and time formats

The most convenient and simple date formats in Workflow are Short, Medium, and Long:

-   *Short:* Displays only numerical values in the result, as `6/1/17`.
    
-   *Medium:* Displays the three-letter abbreviation of the month and doesn’t use slashes, as `Jun 1, 2017`.
    
-   *Long:* Displays the full text of month’s name, as `June 1, 2017`.
    
    You can also set the date format to None to exclude date information from the result and only display the time.

Separately, you can choose a Short, Medium, or Long format for the time of day:

-   *Short:* Displays the time in hours and minutes, as `2:41 PM`.
    
-   *Medium:* Displays the time in hours, minutes, and seconds, as `2:41:36 PM`.
    
-   *Long:* Displays the time in hours, minutes, seconds, and time zone, as `2:41:36 PM PST`.
    
    You can also set the time format to None to exclude time information from the result.
