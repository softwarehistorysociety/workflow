In addition to working with APIs, dictionaries can also be a useful way to work with structured data in your workflows. Use dictionaries in the following ways:

-   Enter text, numbers, values, dictionaries, or lists into a Dictionary action to manually create a dictionary for use in your workflows.
    
-   Use the Get Dictionary from Input action to turn text containing JSON or .plist data into a dictionary item.
    
-   Create a JSON dictionary without coding it manually by entering all of the values into a Dictionary action and copying the results.
    
-   Use the Dictionary Magic Variable to extract a set of values repeatedly throughout a workflow.
    
-   Use a dictionary to make a rich display of data in a Choose from List action, which displays the keys as menu options and the keys’ values as a preview; then, when you choose a key, the action passes the corresponding value into the next action.
