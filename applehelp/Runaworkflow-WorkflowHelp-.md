## Run a workflow

When you open Workflow, the My Workflows screen appears, listing all of the workflows you’ve created or downloaded. You can run any of these workflows.

Workflow performs each action in the workflow sequentially (from top to bottom as listed in the workflow composer). To cancel the workflow, tap ![](https://help.apple.com/workflow/en.lproj/GlobalArt/IL_Stop.png).

If the last action in the sequence had a result, it appears in a small preview window below the workflow.

*Note:* Alternatively, you can launch a workflow without opening the Workflow app. For example, you can [run workflows in iOS Today View](https://help.apple.com/workflow/#/apda11a05448), [run workflows from other apps](https://help.apple.com/workflow/#/apd163eb9f95), [run workflows from Apple Watch](https://help.apple.com/workflow/#/apda76e13e28), and [more](https://help.apple.com/workflow/#/apd80658205e).
