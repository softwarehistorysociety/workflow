## Ask for Input

Ask for Input is a powerful action that allows you to enter information at the time your workflow is run. The action presents a dialog that asks a question. When you enter the answer and tap OK, the data is passed into the next action or is stored as a [Magic Variable](https://help.apple.com/workflow/#/apdd2b316022) to be retrieved later.

Ask for Input supports the entry of words, dates, or numbers, and the keyboard adapts to each input type. Additionally, Ask for Input allows you to specify a default value that pre-fills the dialog. When you run the workflow, you can adjust the pre-filled information.

The Ask for Input action works well with “logging” workflows, such as workflows that log health data or create journal entries.

**Tip:** Use an Ask for Input action that’s set to Number to quickly enter numbers in iOS Today View with a number pad. On Apple Watch, you can enter numbers, dates, and words with dictation or by using Scribble.
