## Order of actions overview

The key to building a workflow is arranging actions in the right order so that they properly accomplish the task at hand. As you use Workflow, you’ll notice that many workflows follow a similar pattern of actions:

-   *Get actions:* The first actions bring content into the workflow. See [Get actions](https://help.apple.com/workflow/#/apd5c2bd430f).
    
-   *Transform actions:* The middle group of actions in a workflow transform the content into a different format. See [Transform actions](https://help.apple.com/workflow/#/apd1d9413cfb).
    
-   *Share actions:* The final actions in a workflow often share data with a service or launch data in another app. See [Share actions](https://help.apple.com/workflow/#/apdaf74d75a5).
    

These aren’t hard-and-fast rules, of course; many workflows omit one or more of these action types. But keeping the *get-transform-share* order of actions in mind can help you build more efficient workflows.
