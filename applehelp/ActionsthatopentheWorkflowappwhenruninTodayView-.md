When an action can’t be completed in Today View, the Workflow app opens to finish the job. For example, actions that display a user interface or require the user to enter data cause the Workflow app to open. Actions that cause the Workflow app to open include those that:

-   Preview content using Quick Look
    
-   Ask you to enter text
    
-   Ask you to pick dates
    
-   Use the camera or microphone
    
-   Ask you to select photos, music, or contacts
    
-   Use the Ask When Run variable
    
-   Have actions with a Show Compose Sheet or Show File Picker option turned on
    
-   Change the screen brightness
    

Additionally, some tasks are too memory-intensive for Today View. Workflows dealing with high volumes of content or large file sizes may need to open in Workflow to finish.

*Note:* If “Unable to Load” is displayed in Today View, the Workflow widget has run out of memory. As a workaround, add a Continue In App action near the beginning of your workflow. When the workflow reaches the Continue In App action, the Workflow app opens to finish the workflow (which is no longer subject to the memory limitations of the widget environment).
