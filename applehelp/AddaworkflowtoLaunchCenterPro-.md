Using a launchpad of icons that quickly open apps as well as complex actions within apps, the Launch Center Pro app’s integration with the Workflow app makes it a powerful way to quickly group and run your workflows.

You can use Launch Center Pro’s scheduled and location-based notifications to receive alerts to run a workflow at predetermined times or locations.

*Note:* The Workflow app and the Launch Center Pro app use the term *action* in two different ways. In Workflow, an action is a single step in a workflow. In Launch Center Pro, an action is a quick shortcut that launches a URL.

This section assumes you have set up your personalized grid of Launch Center Pro actions (LCP actions). For more information, see the [Launch Center Pro documentation](https://help.contrast.co/hc/en-us).

*Note:* Launch Center Pro must be installed on your iOS device in order to add workflows to the Launch Center Pro app.
