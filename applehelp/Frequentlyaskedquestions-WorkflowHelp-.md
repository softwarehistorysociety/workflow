## Frequently asked questions

## Can I sync my workflows between devices?

Yes. To set up sync, tap Sign In to Enable Sync at the bottom of the My Workflows screen. Learn more in [Sync workflows](https://help.apple.com/workflow/#/apd82e4718d2).

## Does Workflow support my favorite app or service?

A list of supported apps and services is not available on the web. However, a complete list of supported apps and services can be found inside of the app.

To search, open a workflow in the app, tap Actions (the magic wand), then enter the app or service name in the Search field at the top of the Actions list.

If you can’t locate the app or service in the search field, try adding the Open App action or Open In action to your workflow and then look for the app or service in the Choose menu.

## How do I build a workflow that does X?

The Workflow app Gallery is a great place to discover workflows with a wide variety of capabilities. Search through the Gallery screen in the app to see what’s possible and how particular workflows are built.
