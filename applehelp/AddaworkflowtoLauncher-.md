Launcher is an iOS app that offers quick shortcuts for launching apps, websites, music, and contacts from the iOS notifications screen.

In the Launcher app, you can create up to six separate widgets of launchable actions, or *launchers*. Each launcher can be set to show or hide at a specific time or location. In combination with the Workflow app, you can set up widgets containing workflows specific to your current location or to the time of day, making it easy to run the right workflow at just the right moment.

For example, you can create a widget that contains a set of business-related workflows that appear only when you’re at the office, or a widget that contains household-related workflows that appear only when you’re at home.

*Note:* Launcher must be installed on your iOS device in order to add workflows to the Launcher app.
