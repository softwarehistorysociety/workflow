## The flow of content

When you run a workflow, information is passed from action to action and transformed along the way. This information, or *content*, can be any type of data—text, photos, videos, URLs, calendar events, songs, contacts, Health data, Maps locations, and much more.

Any number of items can be passed from one action to the next. Content is mostly invisible in the workflow as it’s handed from action to action. And when a workflow finishes, the content is discarded and the workflow reset for the next time you run it.

Consider the following workflow, which contains a Get Latest Photos action followed by a Tweet action. When run, the workflow prompts you to tweet the latest photos from your Camera Roll.

The Get Latest Photos action retrieves and outputs the photos most recently saved to the Camera Roll. In this example, multiple items are passed between actions: the Get Latest Photos action passes three images, sorted in order from most recent to oldest, to the Tweet action.
