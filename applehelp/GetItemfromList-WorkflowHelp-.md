## Get Item from List

Use the Get Item from List action to automatically narrow down a list of items. When a list is passed to the action, you can retrieve the first item or the last item in the list, a random item, or a particular item by its *index*—that is, its order in the list.

You can also retrieve multiple items from the list by providing a range of indexes. For example, if you pass a list of six items into the Get Item from List action and set the index to 3, the third item in the list is retrieved. If you pass a list of six items into the Get Item from List action and set the index to a range of 3 to 6, the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth items in the list are retrieved.
