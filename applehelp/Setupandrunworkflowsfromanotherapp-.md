You can run a workflow from within another app to process content without leaving that app. Workflows that are set to the Action Extension type are accessible from other apps, via the Share button ![](https://help.apple.com/workflow/en.lproj/GlobalArt/IL_Share.png).

An Action Extension helps users view or transform content originating in a host app. For example, using an Action Extension workflow, you can grab all the images from a page in Safari, convert a text file you’re viewing to a PDF, or make edits and act on images in your Photos library.
