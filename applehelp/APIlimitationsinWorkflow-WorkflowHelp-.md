## API limitations in Workflow

There are a few limitations when working with APIs in Workflow:

-   *OAuth:* OAuth 2, a system of authentication that requires a user to manually enter their username and password on a login page, is currently not supported.
    
-   *Various endpoints:* APIs often have a variety of endpoints that you can use to request different types of data. Working with some APIs may require a series of API calls, first to retrieve current existing data, and then later to add, update, or delete more data.
    
-   *Rate limiting:* Many APIs have limitations at how often you can make requests, aimed at limiting abuse of their service if someone makes thousands or millions of requests programmatically. They can be limited by hour, day, or month, or may require you to pay for the service after reaching a certain amount.
    
    *Note:* Usage of any web APIs in Workflow is subject to any terms and conditions of that service.
    
    Because you're creating a custom API key for your own use within Workflow, you probably won’t reach the usage limits. However, using Repeat actions to make a large number of requests in a short period of time may lead to usage overages. If you do reach a usage limit, you may need to wait until your service is restored and/or batch your processes to perform a limited amount of operations at a time.
