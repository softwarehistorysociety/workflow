## Technical standards

Used for more technical purposes, Workflow supports standard formats such as ISO 8601 and RFC 2822:

-   *ISO 8601:* The date portion follows the format `YYYY-MM-DD`, displaying as `2017-06-01`. If an ISO time is included, the time and time zone are appended to the date after a `T` designator, displaying as `2016-06-01T14:41:36-08:00`.
    
    *Note:* The ISO 8601 format is particularly helpful for keeping dates in order—a list of ISO 8601 dates is displayed in chronological order when the files are sorted alphabetically from A-Z.
    
-   *RFC 2822:* An Internet Message Format used to uniformly represent date and time, including in HTTP and email headers. RFC 2822 includes the shortened day of week, numerical date, three-letter month abbreviation, year, time, and time zone, displaying as `01 Jun 2016 14:31:46 -0700`.
    
    *Note:* RFC 2282 is rarely used outside of the Internet—if you don’t already know what it is, chances are you don’t need it. For more information, see [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822).
