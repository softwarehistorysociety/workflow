## List actions overview

When working with multiple items in a workflow, you can use list actions to create ordered lists of data that are passed onto the next action in a workflow. You can also use list actions to narrow lists—manually or automatically, limiting what’s passed on to the next action. There are three list actions: List, Choose from List, and Get Item from List.
