## Prompts overview

If you want to display or enter information while your workflow is running, use the Ask for Input, Show Alert, or Show Notification action, or use an Ask When Run variable.

Using actions and variables in this way lets you create workflows that are more dynamic—you can set up a structure for what occurs in your workflow, but you don’t need to fill in all of the information as you build the workflow. Instead, you can leave certain options to be decided at runtime.

![Workflows containing prompts](https://help.apple.com/workflow/en.lproj/Art/S0240_MentalLoad.png)

For example, you can create a workflow that asks questions about your day and enters the answers in a journal, such as [this Dear Diary workflow](https://workflow.is/workflows/bf0746005d574250b7406887ed7268e9). Or, you can create a more complicated workflow with prompts that fill out each portion of an email template, combine all of the portions, then send the email, such as [this example workflow](https://workflow.is/workflows/3a1a6f42a36947da8dcf9ff43231e0cf).
