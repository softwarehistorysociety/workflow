## Import a workflow

You can import `.wflow` files into the Workflow app and add them to your collection. This is useful, for example, if you want to share a workflow online and provide a link for others to quickly add it to their library.

A URL to import a workflow into My Workflows takes the following structure:

`workflow://import-workflow?url=[url]&name=[name]`

The following parameters can be provided in the URL:

-   *url:* A URL pointing to the `.wflow` file you want to import.
    
-   *name (optional):* What to name the new workflow. If not provided, the workflow filename is used.
    
-   *silent (optional):* By default, the imported workflow is opened and displayed to the user. Set this parameter to `true` to import without opening the workflow.
    

*Note:* You’ll be prompted before running a workflow imported from another app for the first time. This prompt ensures that arbitrary workflows are not run without your permission.
