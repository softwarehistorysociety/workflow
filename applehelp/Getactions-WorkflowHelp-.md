## Get actions

*Get actions* are all about retrieving content and bringing it into the workflow. As you build your workflow, you can [search for get actions](https://help.apple.com/workflow/#/apdc33e4f4da?sub=apd4287f86d0) using keywords like *get*, *search*, *find*, and *select*. Actions like Get Latest Photos, Search Local Businesses, and Find Music look into their respective apps, get content, and then send it to the next action.

Additionally, there are actions that store content directly in the workflow: Date, Street Address, Phone Number, Text, Contact, Email Address, Dictionary, List, and URL. Using these actions lets you pass a specific type of content into another action in your workflow, with the data entered into the action manually or set using variables.

When gathering actions at the beginning of your workflow, ask yourself, “What information does my workflow need to retrieve each time it’s run?” The answer to this question will help you determine which get actions you might need. Perhaps your workflow needs to grab photos, music, videos, or health data stored on your device, fetch content from the Internet, or ask you to enter text (using the Ask for Input action).
