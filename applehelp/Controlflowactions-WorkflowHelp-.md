## Control flow actions

Once you move into more complex workflows, you’ll see some actions that express logic and change the flow of the workflow, where groups of actions may be skipped or separated. Here are a few examples of these special types of actions:

## Variables

*Variables* temporarily save some content for use later in a workflow. Often, actions used in conjunction with variables will not connect to any other actions, but their output will be used later in the workflow. See [Use variables](https://help.apple.com/workflow/#/apdd02c2780c).

## If actions

The *If action* checks for certain conditions in a workflow and operates differently depending on which condition is met. Your your actions can take different paths depending on conditions that are known only when the workflow runs. When the workflow reaches the If action during its run, the content follows the path that fits the conditional requirements. See [Use If actions](https://help.apple.com/workflow/#/apd83dcd1b51).

## Repeat actions

*Repeat actions* are used to perform the same actions repeatedly, creating loops. Actions within a repeat loop run from top to bottom of the list of actions, and then jump back to the top, repeating the series as many times as necessary. The input and output for repeat actions work a little differently. See [About Repeat actions](https://help.apple.com/workflow/#/apdc11deb2c1).

## Choose from Menu

*Choose from Menu actions* present a menu to the user for deciding which direction a workflow should head. You can run entirely different series of actions based on which option the user chooses. See [Choose from Menu](https://help.apple.com/workflow/#/apdd7bf369da).
