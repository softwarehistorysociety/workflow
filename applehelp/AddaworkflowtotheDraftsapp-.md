Drafts is a note-taking app for iOS that includes powerful actions for integrating with other services, similar to the Workflow app. Drafts is a popular tool for automating text entry on iOS. Using the in-app actions in the Drafts app, you can easily write notes and send the contents to Workflow.

*Note:* Drafts must be installed on your iOS device in order to add workflows to the Drafts app.

*Note:* In the Drafts app, the primary tool is called an *action*, and the tool’s individual components are called “action steps.” In Workflow, the primary unit is called a *workflow*, and the workflow’s individual component steps are called *actions*. To avoid confusion, workflows imported into the Drafts app are referred to as “Workflow Drafts actions” in this section.
