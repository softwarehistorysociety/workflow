## Action connections

When an action uses content provided by the action before it, a line appears down the center of the list of actions, connecting the actions together. This line indicates that the output of the action will be used as input to the following action.

Many Workflow actions can accept input and provide output. Some actions accept only input, create only output, or pass input through as output without changing it.

Tap an action’s icon in the list of actions to see a description of the action, the types of inputs it accepts, and the types of outputs it provides.

Some actions accept only specific types of content as input. Actions that aren’t compatible appear in the list without a connecting line, to show that the actions won’t work together. For example, the Get Current Location can’t provide an output for the Create Playlist action because the Create Playlist action requires a song item, not a Map location.

Some actions don’t take input and only produce output. These are typically “getter” actions, like Get Upcoming Events, Get Current Song, or Select Photos, all of which simply retrieve data. An action that doesn’t take input appears in the list of actions separated from the previous action, without a center connecting line.

Some actions accept content as input but don’t change it, passing the same content as output. For example, the Vibrate Device action shakes your device in between actions while passing input to the next action. Similarly, passing a phone number as input to the Call action places a phone call to that number; when the call finishes, the Call action produces that same phone number as its output.
