Using iOS Search, you can quickly locate and open a workflow without having to open the Workflow app.

1.  On your iOS device, do one of the following:
    
    -   From the Home screen, swipe down from the center.
        
    -   From the Lock Screen or Home screen, swipe from the left.
        
    -   From an app, swipe down from the top, then swipe from the left.
        
    
    **Tip:** If you have an external keyboard connected to your iOS device, you can press Command-Space bar to open Search from any location in iOS.
    
2.  Type the name of the workflow in the search field.
    
    A list of results forms as you type. Search results are sorted in alphabetical order, so you may need to scroll to locate your workflows. Each workflow result displays the icon, name, and number of actions in the workflow.

3.  Tap a workflow.
    
    The Workflow app opens and immediately runs the workflow.
