## Delete workflows

When it’s time to part ways with a workflow, you can easily delete it.

Any workflows you delete are removed from all of your iOS devices that are signed in with your [Workflow account](https://help.apple.com/workflow/#/apd82e4718d2).

## Delete a workflow

1.  In the My Workflows screen, touch and hold any workflow icon until the icons jiggle.
    
2.  Tap one or more workflow icon (the icon colors darken to indicate selection), then tap ![](https://help.apple.com/workflow/en.lproj/GlobalArt/IL_Trash.png).
