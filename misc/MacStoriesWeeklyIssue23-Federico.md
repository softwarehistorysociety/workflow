## [Telegram](https://club.macstories.net/posts/telegram)

When it comes to messaging, Apple’s iMessage gets many things right – for one, it’s built into iOS and has good Siri and watchOS integration – but its evolution has been slow compared to messaging services from other companies. Apps like Messenger, WhatsApp, LINE, and WeChat have shown how reaching a wider audience doesn’t mean having to put a stop on innovation. Messenger, for instance, is going beyond traditional messaging with app integrations and [an entire platform](https://www.messenger.com/platform) for developers to build upon.

For a long time, I’ve been looking for a modern messaging app with a solid app doc system on iOS, OS X, and watchOS. I’ve found that app in [Telegram](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/telegram-messenger/id686449807?mt=8&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_weekly). Initially [launched](http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/27/meet-telegram-a-secure-messaging-app-from-the-founders-of-vk-russias-largest-social-network/) as a free and secure alternative to WhatsApp heavily inspired by its UI and interactions, Telegram has grown into a service used by [over 100 million users](http://www.wired.com/2016/02/encrypted-messaging-app-telegram-hits-100-million-people/) with apps for iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch. While WhatsApp continues to remain more popular among the majority of my friends, it doesn’t have an iPad app; Telegram does, and it even supports the latest iOS technologies such as Split View and document providers to share any kind of file with someone else.

Since I discovered the appeal of Telegram, I’ve convinced my parents and some friends to start using it in lieu of WhatsApp; so far, everyone tells me they’re liking it more than WhatsApp because of its speed (Telegram is *fast*), cross-platform availability (the iPad app is especially welcome), and ability to share GIFs and stickers natively inside chats. In Telegram, you can install [custom sticker packs](https://telegram.org/blog/stickers-revolution) from the web – you can spend hours discovering cute dog stickers or silly meme packs. Thanks to [inline bots](https://telegram.org/blog/inline-bots), you can look up GIFs from Giphy just by typing, but also insert results from YouTube video search, IMDB, or Wikipedia.

There are dozens of smaller features and nice details that make Telegram, in many ways, superior to iMessage. There are per-contact notification settings with mute options. You can subscribe to channels (think Twitter-like feeds from publications and brands, but in a messaging UI) or create groups with up to 1,000 people. There’s a [secret chat option](https://telegram.org/faq#q-how-are-secret-chats-different) where everything will encrypted end-to-end, stored outside of the Telegram cloud, and with the option to self-destruct. Web links are shared with handy inline previews. The photo picker is *great* as it embeds a live camera button that cuts down the number of choices required to pick a photo or take a new one. I could go on.

In short, [Telegram](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/telegram-messenger/id686449807?mt=8&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_weekly) is a fantastic messaging service that I should have considered a long time ago. Telegram offers a lot of fresh ideas for what modern messaging should be like, and I’m impressed by their iOS apps. If you’ve been looking for a different take on messaging on iOS and don’t want to use Messenger or WhatsApp, you should give Telegram a try.

## [iOS Writer's Toolbox, Vol. 2](https://club.macstories.net/posts/ios-writers-toolbox-vol-2)

iOS text editors are great, and some, like Editorial, have vast amounts of power built in that allow you to do amazing things with your writing. But there is also a rich world of other apps on iOS that fill the specific needs of writers and that don’t tie you to one particular editor.

### Dictionaries

## Terminology

I mentioned [Terminology](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/terminology-3-extensible-dictionary/id687798859?mt=8&uo=4&at=11lbfL&ct=ms020) in last week’s Mac OS X tip. Terminology for iOS is an excellent dictionary and thesaurus app from Agile Tortoise. Like Phraseology, Terminology is tightly integrated with Agile Tortoise’s flagship app [Drafts](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-4-quickly-capture-notes/id905337691?mt=8&at=11lbfL&ct=ms020). With the introduction of Drafts 4.6, you can even send selected text from Drafts to Terminology with a URL scheme action and pick an alternate word to use, which is sent back to Drafts where it replaces the selected text.

## Urban Dictionary

Not every word you run across on the web is in a proper dictionary. If you want to keep up with the kids these days, [Urban Dictionary](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/urban-dictionary/id584986228?mt=8&uo=4&at=11lbfL&ct=ms020) will usually get you there.

## Google Translate

When I run into tweets or websites in languages I don’t know, [Google Translate](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-translate/id414706506?mt=8&uo=4&at=11lbfL&ct=ms020) is my go-to. It’s not perfect, but it usually gives me a good idea of the idea being communicated.

### Special Characters and Symbols

![](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/9f4b80a35728f7271fe3ea6ff/images/945e765a-ba0a-49c6-852a-4a0185682e10.jpg)

## Simbol

[Simbol](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/simbol/id792334901?mt=8&uo=4&at=11lbfL&ct=ms020) organizes special characters into easy-to-browse categories. You can also search for symbols by their names and other criteria. An equation editor at the top of the list of symbols lets you combine symbols to create equations that you can then paste into your documents.

## Uniconsole

[Uniconsole](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/uniconsole/id320895862?mt=8&uo=4&at=11lbfL&ct=ms020) is great for fast access to alternate alphabets and Unicode characters that are not readily available on iOS. Uniconsole is handy for finding things like accented characters, but who am I kidding? I mostly use it to send bubble text messages on Ⓣⓦⓘⓣⓣⓔⓡ.

You can also download a free ad-supported version called [Uniconsole Free](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/uniconsole-free/id328331353?mt=8&uo=4&at=11lbfL&ct=ms020).

## Kaomoji

Kaomoji, which originated in Japan, are fun. There are a bunch of kaomoji apps on the App Store and despite lacking proper support for the iPhone 6s Plus, I think I like [Kaomoji](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kaomoji-cute-little-emoticons/id604813503?mt=8) (the app) is still the best because it organizes the kaomoji into categories that make them easy to browse and find. Kaomoji don’t come in handy too often when I’m writing here at MacStories, but like Uniconsole’s bubble text, they are perfect for Twitter, Slack, and the like.

Ok, back to writing. φ（．．）

It's the weekend (or almost is) and you deserve a break. Here's something we enjoyed watching, playing, reading, or listening to.

![](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/9f4b80a35728f7271fe3ea6ff/images/e6da5fe2-1438-44a8-a950-0fd1b94ba929.jpg)

## The People v. O.J. Simpson

**TV Series**

[Purchase on iTunes](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/tv-season/people-v.-o.j.-simpson-american/id1065136690?at=1001l8q4&mt=4&ct=mcstr)

My latest TV show obsession is [American Crime Story: The People v O.J. Simpson](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/tv-season/people-v.-o.j.-simpson-american/id1065136690?at=1001l8q4&mt=4&ct=mcstr). This first season of American Crime Story, as the subtitle makes clear, focuses on the so-called “trial of the century” in which O.J. Simpson was tried for the murder of Nicole Simpson and Ronald Goldman. Following on from other outstanding true crime stories such as Serial, The Jinx, and Making a Murderer, what makes American Crime Story different is that this show is a *re-enactment* of the story. It may be a dramatization, but it sticks fairly closely to the facts (and when you have such extraordinary events as happened in reality, there’s little reason for them to bend the truth anyway). It’s a fantastic show with great acting, writing and production – I thought this week’s episode which focused on prosecutor Marcia Clark was particularly outstanding.

Tips and tricks to master your apps and be more productive.

I’m fairly certain that the most used app on my iPhone is Tweetbot, and I suspect that’s the same for many of you. Recently I started to try and learn some of the many gestures that are built into Tweetbot, and I thought I’d share some of the more less obvious ones:

-   Swipe left/right on the navigation bar (where it says Timeline) to switch between different Twitter accounts instantly.
-   Swipe down with two fingers to switch to dark mode, and swipe up with two fingers to switch to light mode.
-   When composing a tweet, tap on your avatar to switch to a different account.
-   Tap and hold on the RT or Like button to RT or Like from a different account.
-   Tap and hold on a hashtag or Twitter account to have the option to mute the hashtag/account.
-   Swipe right on a Tweet to follow the conversation, and swipe left to Like or reply to it.
-   If you have an iPhone 6s, you can use 3D Touch to “peek and pop” on various elements of the app from Twitter accounts, to URLs, to images, and more.

**Question:** Hi, could you highlight some of the lightweight stuff Hazel can help with that could be useful for time-saving? Like keeping a clean desktop, unzip and delete zip-files etc. What are some of the best hacks that could suit a lot of people? (Joakim)

[Hazel](https://www.noodlesoft.com/), by Noodlesoft, is a versatile rule-based utility for automating folder and file actions on the Mac. Here are some examples.

To clean up your desktop each day, first select, or add, the Desktop folder in the left pane of Hazel. To add a rule, select the ‘+’ button and then set up the conditions you want to match and the action you want Hazel to take.

In the screenshot below, I have set up a rule that checks the date that a file was added to the desktop and moves it if the file was added before the current date. Of course the beauty of Hazel is that you can adjust each of the parameters I set to suit your specific needs.

### Unzip and Delete

I use two actions for to unzip and delete files. The first unarchives ZIP and other archive file formats in my Downloads folder and moves the unarchived files to the Documents folder. The second moves archive files older than one month to the Trash.

[![](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/9f4b80a35728f7271fe3ea6ff/images/678abdbf-b07a-455e-8981-3cbceccf05d4.png)](https://bddf794624247cea6a0b-b4761d2ba0154d0278c36dbf2b3c114d.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/screenshot-2016-03-09-14-16-251457563271369.png)

### Consolidate Music, Movies, and Photos

There are several built-in rules to get you started with Hazel. One set that is nice are rules that move music files to the Music folder, movie files to the Movies folder, and images to the Photos folder. The rules below show rules for moving music and images.

[![](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/9f4b80a35728f7271fe3ea6ff/images/db8a1b17-15e3-4409-906d-52f5d50795d4.png)](https://bddf794624247cea6a0b-b4761d2ba0154d0278c36dbf2b3c114d.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/screenshot-2016-03-09-14-16-251457554948909.png)

### Take out the Trash

Another nice feature of Hazel is the Trash pane that lets you set a maximum trash can size, duration for holding files, and clean up after apps that scatter files across your Mac’s file system and are not normally deleted when you uninstall an app. This is particularly useful with laptops that have limited storage.

[![](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/9f4b80a35728f7271fe3ea6ff/images/07dd1922-772a-4705-94e5-0cb205126142.png)](https://bddf794624247cea6a0b-b4761d2ba0154d0278c36dbf2b3c114d.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/screenshot-2016-03-09-13-47-391457554422730.png)

**Question:** I’d like to send copied URLs to Instapaper via the Workflow Today widget, but while preserving the title of a page. The workflows I’ve tried so far (including the one you provided in MacStories Weekly Issue 20) don’t grab a page’s title, and anything added to Instapaper this way has the URL as a title instead. Not even re-downloading an article in Instapaper (via long-tap) fixes this. (Jerome Dahdah, [@parasight](https://twitter.com/parasight))

This has been fixed in the latest release of Workflow, version 1.4.4. URLs you send to Instapaper will now automatically grab the correct title from the original webpage, so you’ll have proper article titles in your Instapaper queue.

**Question:** I would like to use Spark to email cleaned links (Expand URL action). It looks like Spark has x-callback-url support, but I haven’t made it work yet. Also, if you know of any other Spark and Workflow uses that would be great. (Toby)

This can be done by using the [Spark URL scheme](https://helpspot.readdle.com/spark/index.php?pg=kb.page&id=791) and Workflow’s Open URL action. We can have a URL-encoded subject field in the Spark URL scheme (you could switch this to a variable of your choosing, or use a webpage’s title as subject – provided you always URL-encode this text) and use the Input variable to pass a cleaned link as body text. You can even set a recipient for the new message that will open in Spark’s composer.

![](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/9f4b80a35728f7271fe3ea6ff/images/ee1d1574-5694-4af3-ab9c-eaaa9df977e4.jpg)

I created a workflow that gets a link from your clipboard, fetches its name from the web using the Get Name action, and then asks you to pick a contact to send the link to. If the contact has multiple email addresses (extracted with Select Contact + Get Details of Contact), you’ll be asked to pick one, which will be used in the composer.

You can download the workflow [here](https://workflow.is/workflows/b8d93daa32af41c48de332e4e298ab3c).

**Question:** I do the social media for the small consignment store that I work for. Once a week, I go around and take a bunch of photos of the most interesting items in the store and post them to Instagram with the caption:

> `Lot: <lot number of item> <Description of item> Reserve: <reserve price of item>`

I’ve set up IFTTT to upload these photos to a new Facebook album each week, as well as post these photos to a Twitter account.

My only problem with this is typing the caption each time can be a little fiddly; I keep the basic template saved in Copied (which I access from the Today View Widget) but moving the insertion point on iOS can be a pain, and I’d prefer to use the iOS Camera app instead of the one built into Instagram (as I prefer to have the grid view overlaid over my camera to better line up my photos), but then I’d have to switch back and forth between Instagram and the camera app.

Is there a way I can run a Workflow from the share sheet once I take a photo, get it to prompt me for the 3 variables for the caption and throw me over to Instagram to post the photo? (Luke Bennett, [@luke\_bennett](https://twitter.com/luke_bennett))

Yes, with one minor caveat: you’ll have to paste the caption text manually into the Caption field of Instagram because setting the caption beforehand in Workflow doesn’t seem to be working right now.

With the workflow I put together, you’ll be able to share a photo from the Photos app with the share sheet. The workflow will ask you to enter three captions – the lot, description, and the reserve field. These three separate captions will be joined in one single caption by a Text caption, and the final text will be copied to the clipboard. Then, the workflow will send the selected picture to Instagram. After confirming the photo and applying effects, paste text in the Caption field, and you should be good to go.

You can download the workflow [here](https://workflow.is/workflows/422ed78b31b844a18b835ee1b4b62a2e).

## Top Workflows

I’m often asked by MacStories readers and Club MacStories members to share the workflows I use on a daily basis. While I have dozens of workflows in Workflow (I still don’t like saying this, by the way), there are some I consider my “top” ones. Here’s a list with links to download them.

[Combine Screenshots](https://workflow.is/workflows/222a4eb3342d4318956c6db5a556761e)

I use this workflow every day to combine screenshots (usually iPhone ones) in one final image I can use in MacStories articles. The workflow can be used as an action extension from the Photos app, or you can run it inside Workflow and pick the images you want to combine manually.

[Combine Frames](https://workflow.is/workflows/484ac75801374b7f835d77335a1bb62a)

Quite possibly, one of the most complex workflows I’ve created. With this one, I can put iPhone and iPad screenshots into Apple’s device frames (so the final result will be pretty and professional). I have [shared the details of how this works](https://www.macstories.net/ios/workflow-1-4-4-brings-more-image-automation-html-to-markdown-conversion/) earlier this week.

[Publish to WordPress](https://workflow.is/workflows/8084ce794c1949f09ccf0be0096a2a21)

This is the workflow I use every time I publish a post on MacStories from my iPhone or iPad. From Drafts, Editorial, or 1Writer (the workflow works with anything as long as the post’s title is copied to the clipboard first), I can share Markdown text with the workflow, which will ask me to confirm the post’s title, pick categories and tags, and choose if I want to have a normal post or a linked one. This is made specifically for our custom WordPress features at MacStories, but you can modify it to your needs. Here’s the [workflow I use in Editorial](http://www.editorial-workflows.com/workflow/5781669487312896/TuqvFrI9RHg) to send text to it.

[Resize Safari Image](https://workflow.is/workflows/38f272dc0d0e4cd2918741dbf50ff373)

The featured articles displayed at the top of MacStories require a smaller version of the “hero image”, usually around 640-pixel wide. Because I don’t want to save this image manually every time, I use this workflow to select an image from a post on the web, resize it, upload it to our CDN, and open it in a new tab to confirm it’s looking good.

[Markdown Selection](https://workflow.is/workflows/5fd67ead36cf4f219ce193b9f1851532)

When I create linked posts on MacStories, I want to keep the formatting of the original source intact. Using the copy & paste menu in Safari doesn’t copy as rich text, so I use this workflow to extract the selection on a webpage and convert it to Markdown, copying it to the clipboard.

[Submit a Shortcut Request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeViYJRP69lNKgbmNWqxY1iEnz851gLE375swzC12Qarm-RxA/viewform?usp=sf_link)

Your weekly correspondence with the MacStories team.

**Question:** I heard Federico spell this out in a recent episode of Canvas, but I’m still running into problems. When using trackpad mode to select text on the iPad, how does one switch between manipulating the “in” and “out” of the selection? I’ve found myself getting stuck only moving around the second selection point, unable to change the first. Is there a shortcut or gesture to toggle in between them? (bk)

With text selected, a two-finger drag will start moving the starting point (in), while a two-finger hold & drag will move the end point (out). You can recognize that hold & drag has been activated by the cursor animation on screen.

**Question:** I decided to get serious about losing weight and so have increased my exercise, lowered my food intake and bought a Beurer electronic scale. The GS485 is great – it looks nice (not ‘trendy’), is easy to use and sends all my weigh ins to an iOS app which in turn sends it to HealthKit. That’s all wonderful but I’m finding the data side of things less than wonderful. The Health app’s presentation is quirky – not least the ever-changing graph scale – and I’m stuck with only day, week, month, or year views.

Can you recommend anything which will allow me to get a little more control over graphing my weight? I’d like to set the time period to a specific range (since I started on this kick), set a sensible scale that doesn’t change, and add a trend line so I can see how I’m tracking overall without all the speed bumps. A nice to have would include goal tracking.

PS. It’s working – I’m the lightest I’ve been in probably 20 years, have already hit my first milestone and am well on the way to my next. (Allister Jenks, [@zkarj](https://twitter.com/zkarj))

First of all, congratulations. That’s a big milestone, and I wish you well for the future.

I’m not particularly an expert about weight tracking dashboards for iOS – I own a Withings scale (Smart Body Analyzer) which has its own app, and I used [FitPort](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/fitport-your-fitness-dashboard/id914413310?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_weekly) in the past, but it doesn’t have the kind of control that you’re looking for, I think. I’ve heard good things about [FitMetrics](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/fitmetrics-your-fitness-health/id965643854?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_weekly), which should show you plenty of data types and charts, but it hasn’t been updated in a while. Still, it’s free to download, so you should give it a try.

**Question:** I really enjoy how you have taken several long-form posts and created the ePub format for each of them. I am curious what you use to create them, how you format them (including pictures), and any tips and tricks you may have with putting them together (text format, tools used, footnote handling, etc).

I’ve been thinking of a couple of use cases for myself, and also my brother who is working on his first book. (Tim)

Tim, we write all of our articles in Markdown, so when we first decided to create ePub versions of our long-form content, we wanted something that would be compatible with Markdown. Fortunately we found [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/), which is a universal document converter that can handle Markdown to ePub conversions. [This Pandoc webpage](http://pandoc.org/epub.html) should give you more information on how it works.

We did have to do a little bit of extra work initially in order to get it working exactly the way we wanted it to, and [Brett Terpstra](https://twitter.com/ttscoff) helped us out with that. But now all we need to do is provide a Markdown file, a cover page image and run a one-line command and our custom Pandoc script automatically creates the ePub.

If you want something a little more user-friendly I’d recommend checking out Pages and iBooks Author, both of which can export to ePub.

Trying new things, seeing what works, and discarding what doesn't.

In issue #21 of MacStories Weekly, I focused on finding gaps in the App Store, which is an inherently app-centric perspective on the topic of attention. Today, I am going to flip things around and look at customers and addressing their needs as another component of attention.

I’m sure you have read an interview with a successful developer who is asked why they made their app. A common answer is “To scratch my own itch.” That’s a good place to start, but in most cases, it’s only a small part of the story, or the developer was extremely lucky.

Last weekend I re-watched [a talk on marketing that Marco Arment gave at NSConference in 2015](https://vimeo.com/nsconf/28marcoarment). Marco described the process he went through as a solo developer while deciding whether to make his podcast app, Overcast. Marco wasn’t satisfied with existing podcast players. He had an itch that he wanted to scratch, but first, he did some research.

Marco downloaded all the major podcast apps, tried them, and took notes on what he liked and didn’t like about each. He was looking for gaps in the category to see if there was room for another podcast app. But Marco also considered his potential customers. He estimated the size of the podcast market and considered whether podcast listeners have unsatisfied needs he could solve. It turns out, they did.

Rabid podcast fans wanted to listen to more podcasts, but didn’t have the time. Marco had an idea for a unique audio engine that would compress silences in shows in a natural way that would allow listeners to enjoy more shows in less time without making them sound funny. That’s a simple, marketable story built upon a foundation of clever programming.

Niches are great because their occupants tend to be willing to spend money to satisfy their need. But a niche taken to an extreme is a customer base of one. This is where ‘scratching your own itch’ becomes a self-defeating goal.

But when is a niche too small? When I decided to write Blink, I wanted an easier way to tweet affiliate links to the Squibner apps. I looked around and couldn’t find a good solution. I knew that affiliate linking is a significant source of income for many websites, so I looked to see what writers were doing. On the Mac, writers were using everything from Keyboard Maestro, to TextExpander, to Python scripts to generate affiliate links, but many of those solutions were unavailable on iOS or were clunky alternatives.

I had found a gap in the App Store and a customer niche that wasn’t being served. The next question I had to ask was *why*? Why weren’t there any competitors? Part of the answer was the size of the market. The iTunes affiliate program user base continues to grow, but at the time I released Blink it relatively small. Add to that the fact that only a subset of writers work on iOS, and you have a have a small potential user base. Small, but counterbalanced by the fact that the target audience uses affiliate linking to make money, which meant I could charge more than a couple of dollars for the app.

And that’s the beauty of finding a niche to serve. If you can find a group that has a specific need, especially if it’s one that helps someone get their work done, there’s money to be made. However, the downside of a niche is that depending on its size, it can be saturated. Once you reach that point, sales stagnate, which is why it’s also a good idea to consider whether there are related areas that you can expand into later. Is there a similar category of problem that can be solved with your app, a different group that would benefit from a similar solution or another platform you can bring your app to?

For me the answer was yes. I knew the market for iTunes affiliate linking is small, especially on iOS, but I also recognized that there is room to grow. Developers and tech writers were a natural fit for Blink because they understand the value of the iTunes affiliate program. But the breadth of iTunes means that there is plenty of room to grow other media types like music, movies, TV and books, where affiliate linking is not as well known. Other areas of potential growth include expanding Blink into a more full-featured media research tool for writers, moving into other affiliate programs like Amazon’s, or adding other platforms, like the Mac.

So, while some people may look at an app like Overcast superficially and conclude that Marco woke up one day, scratched an itch by building a podcast app, and sat back and watched the money roll in, the truth is quite different. You might not understand the success of Overcast if Smart Speed isn’t a feature that serves your podcast listening needs, but that’s the point. Marco is serving a niche that’s big enough to sustain his business, not make a general-purpose podcast app for everyone – Apple has that covered. So, next time you feel that itch, before you scratch, consider who else might be served by a solution to your problem. If it’s just you, you might want to reconsider, but if you can find others with a similar unserved need and design a solution not just for yourself, but for them, you just might have a viable product.

I’d like to just point out a few of the most important apps and why I keep them on my Home screen.

[Rise](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/rise-alarm-clock/id577221529?at=10l6nh&ct=ms_weekly). Although I mostly use the alarm on my Apple Watch these days, sometimes I need to be absolutely certain I wake up on time (recently so that I didn’t miss an early flight). I love the user interface in Rise, and the creators ([@simplebots](https://twitter.com/simplebots)) are colleagues/friends of mine.

[Calc Lite](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/pcalc-lite-best-free-calculator/id300311831?mt=8&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_weekly). This is one of the first apps I downloaded. I’ve purchased the full suite of PCalc features via IAP, so the “Lite” is a bit misleading. The best calculator on the App Store.

[Launch Center Pro](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/launch-center-pro-shortcut/id532016360?mt=8&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_weekly) and [Workflow](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/app/workflow-powerful-automation/id915249334?at=10l6nh&ct=ms_weekly). I love automation, and LCP and Workflow are the best automation apps you can get.

[Automatic](https://www.automatic.com/home/). This is the companion app for the Automatic module that plugs into my car. I use this to track mileage and to troubleshoot car issues.

[NetNewsWire](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/netnewswire/id965347329?mt=8&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_weekly). A great RSS reader. This is a more recent update to NetNewsWire Classic, which was another of the very first apps I downloaded.

The last three icons are for builds of my own apps, which I work on in my spare time (I have a day gig as an iOS consultant).

[Taptronome](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/taptronome-modern-gesture/id1005627278?at=10l6nh&ct=ms_weekly&ls=1&mt=8). A modern, gesture-based metronome. Also has an Apple Watch app.

[SketchParty TV](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/sketchparty-tv/id500175028?mt=8&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_weekly). Fast-paced party game for the new Apple TV. This is the companion iOS app.

[MASH](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/mash/id303058767?mt=8&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_weekly). My first iPhone game, originally released in early 2009. For a time it was a top 25 game on the App Store.
