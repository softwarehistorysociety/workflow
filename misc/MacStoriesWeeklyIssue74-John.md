## [Workouts++](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/workouts/id1182551958?mt=8&uo=4&at=11lbfL&ct=linked)

Workouts++ by [David Smith](https://david-smith.org/) has won a permanent spot on my primary Apple Watch face. There are two aspects of the app that made me switch to it from Apple’s Workout app. The first is the degree to which it can be customized. From the iOS app, you can choose from 11 different workout types and whether they are indoor or outdoor. There are also six different Watch face layouts to pick from and nine different metrics that can be tracked. You can also reorder the workouts in the iOS app, which is the order they will show up on your Apple Watch.

While I was recovering from knee surgery, I had Walk, Elliptical, and Other workouts set up. When I would go to physical therapy, I’d usually start with an elliptical warmup followed by a series of strength exercises. I put my Elliptical and Other workouts at the top of the list in Workouts++ so with a quick tap of the app’s complication, I could start the elliptical workout when I arrived and switch to ‘Other’ for the strength exercises.

A close second in importance in my conversion to Workouts++ is its data visualizations available in the iOS app. Workouts are sorted in chronological order by default, but you can also sort by duration, distance, and active calories and filter workouts by type or duration. Tapping on a workout opens a view with additional statistics and three graphs that show heart rate, pace, and speed over time. A final tab in the app shows lifetime stats by workout type, day of the week, and time of day, along with total and average distance statistics for each type of workout.

Apple’s Workout app takes a one-size-fits-all approach to workout tracking. But workout goals and preferences are personal, which is why I prefer Workouts++. David Smith’s app acknowledges those differences and, with a little setup at the outset, lets me quickly start workouts tailored to my specific needs and provides rich data that I can review later at my leisure.

## [Widgets for iOS Apps, Vol. 2](https://club.macstories.net/posts/widgets-for-ios-apps-vol-2)

![](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/9f4b80a35728f7271fe3ea6ff/images/a71c4709-a3cc-4857-953d-292873039d33.jpeg)

## [Timepage](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/timepage-calendar-by-moleskine/id989178902?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_ryan)

The excellent calendar app, Timepage, contains a whopping four different widgets to choose from: Countdown, Month, Today, and Weather. Each widget is beautifully designed and offers valuable information. Countdown is simple, displaying a countdown to a specific event that you’ve chosen to add to the widget. Currently I have WWDC as my chosen countdown event, so the widget always displays the number of days until the conference’s launch. Month is the most impressive of Timepage’s widgets. In expanded view it is essentially a full calendar app inside the widget. You can view each day of the month, with days that contain events highlighted using the app’s heatmap design – days with more events contain bolder highlighting. Selecting a day lists that day’s calendar events below, and beneath that there’s a button that takes you into the app to add a new event. The Today widget contains a digest of the current day, including events on your calendar and basic weather information. Lastly, the Weather widget contains the day’s weather forecast in more detail than the Today widget; you’re probably better off using a dedicated weather app’s widget though.

## [Weather Underground](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/weather-underground-custom-forecast-local-radar/id486154808?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_ryan)

Weather Underground offers two widgets: Radar and Weather. Radar provides a radar snapshot of weather conditions in your surrounding area. The widget does a great job of updating with the latest radar image every time you load it, but it remains only a still image. For a live, constantly updated radar view, you need to hit the play button at the bottom of the widget, which opens the full app. The Weather widget displays the current temperature, high and low for the day, and a summary of current weather conditions. In compact view, you’ll see a 24-hour graph containing different temperature points at four-hour increments. In expanded view, you can switch that graph to instead show hourly temperatures and conditions.

## [Castro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/castro-podcast-player/id1080840241?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_ryan)

Castro was the first major podcast player to [include a widget](https://www.macstories.net/news/castro-makes-accessing-podcasts-easier-than-ever-and-drops-price/) on iOS. Since then, Overcast, Pocket Casts, and even Apple’s own Podcasts app have added widgets. Castro’s remains my favorite, though, due to the way it complements the app’s triage system. Every podcast episode that you’ve added to your queue is included in the app’s widget (up to a max of 12 episodes). You’ll see the podcast’s artwork in the widget, and tapping an episode will immediately play it and move it to the top of your queue. If I could request one change, it would be Castro adding a way to distinguish between different episodes of the same show – currently they bear identical artwork. Perhaps if Apple permits 3D Touch in widgets with iOS 11, that would be a useful way to view a show’s details.

## [Airmail](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/airmail-your-mail-with-you/id993160329?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_ryan)

The popular email client Airmail includes two widgets: Inbox and To Do. I love having the option to quickly view the contents of my inbox from a widget, and Airmail’s implementation works well. The widget displays a sender’s name and profile image, along with the subject line of each email. Tapping an email will open it inside the app. The To Do widget displays all emails that you have marked with Airmail’s own To Do label. I know many people use their email inbox as a sort of to do list, but if you receive more than just a few emails a day, that could quickly become a challenge as your inbox gets cluttered. The option to mark a message with a To Do label makes it easier to see only the emails that you know need a response. And while viewing those messages inside the app works well, it’s nice to also have the option to see them in a dedicated widget.

## [Drafts](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-quickly-capture-notes-share-anywhere/id905337691?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_ryan)

Drafts is an app all about getting thoughts and ideas out of your head and into the app as quickly as possible. It makes sense, then, that the Drafts widget is designed to serve this purpose. In compact view, you’ll see four action buttons in the widget. The first starts a new draft in the app, the second starts a new draft and pastes the contents of your clipboard to it, the third starts a draft with the microphone engaged for dictating your note, while the fourth action opens your Drafts inbox. If you expand the widget, you’ll get a list of the drafts in your inbox so you can quickly access each one. Overall, the widget is fairly simple, but it complements the Drafts system well.

## [Quick Signature Switching in Airmail](https://club.macstories.net/posts/quick-signature-switching-in-airmail)

Airmail is one of the deepest, most customizable apps I use on iOS. Its handling of signatures is no exception. In Airmail you can create multiple signatures for each email account you set up and pick one as the default.

When you compose a message, the default signature is used. One way to pick another signature is to tap the ‘Signatures’ button from the row of buttons above the keyboard. That opens a modal view from which you can pick a different signature.

A faster way to switch signatures, though, is to swipe right for ‘no signature’ or left for alternate signatures you’ve created. Unlike the ‘Signatures’ button that only appears when your cursor is in the compose section of a message, swiping between signatures works even if your cursor is in the ‘To:’ or ‘Subject:’ fields.

## [Find a Free Evening](https://club.macstories.net/posts/find-a-free-evening)

I was inspired by a question sent by member Steven, who asked us for a way to easily find a free evening in his calendar to go out with friends after work:

**Question:** I often find myself trying to schedule post-work events with friends and colleagues. The first inevitable step is to send over a list of dates on which I have no appointments scheduled after [COB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_of_day) (6 PM in my case). It would be incredible if I could select two dates and have a list of dates with free evenings exported out. (Steven Tartick, [@Tartick](http://twitter.com/Tartick))

To my knowledge, the Workflow team had already put together an excellent workflow to share your availability for an entire single day. The workflow, which [can be found on the Workflow Gallery](https://workflow.is/workflows/703443a0652c4c6596d541b218bff567), is incredibly clever as it takes advantage of start dates and variables to find free slots between events in your calendar.

However, as I kept thinking about this request, I realized that I wanted to create something *slightly* different – a workflow optimized for finding free evenings across multiple days at once. This has been a problem for me as well – to be able to find some free time to relax after work – and I figured it’d be fun to solve it with a workflow.

Before I dive into the details of this automation, here’s what the final result looks like:

[![](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/9f4b80a35728f7271fe3ea6ff/images/b2af05de-dc6d-4197-8491-919a3bdc1e73.jpeg)](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2017-04-06-15-37-20.jpeg)

Essentially, what we’re putting together is a workflow that looks into a calendar of your choice for multiple days in a row, and that can find free slots of times within a specific time range – your idea of “evening” when you typically go out and relax.

There’s some setup we need to do. At the beginning of the workflow, you’ll see three ‘Text’ actions. The first one features the plain text name of the calendar you’ll want to parse for events. This has to be the **exact name** of a calendar that is already configured natively on your iOS device, otherwise the workflow will fail. To find a complete list of your calendar names, you can go into Apple’s Calendar app and tap on the ‘Calendars’ button to open a popup with every calendar you’ve configured.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2017-04-06-15-38-23.jpeg)

First, configure your calendar name and time range to indicate when an “evening” starts and ends.

The other two ‘Text’ actions specify the time range you want Workflow to consider. For this workflow, I used “6 PM” and “11 PM”, but you can change that to other times as long as the second action doesn’t go beyond midnight (rolling into the following day). The idea is to isolate a block of time that represents an evening when you’re available to go out. If you’re someone who works night shifts, you can change these to afternoon times.

The main functionality of the workflow starts with an ‘Ask for Input’ action that asks you to enter a number for the days you want to pick. This wouldn’t be necessary if Workflow had a native month picker that let you select multiple days at once, but, unfortunately, such a feature hasn’t been added to the app. The number of days you choose is used as the repetition value in a ‘Repeat’ action. Each pass of the repeat block brings up another ‘Ask for Input’ action, but this time set to ‘Date’ as the input type, which will show you a standard date picker (the scrolling wheel) where you can select a day to parse for events. If you tell the workflow you want to analyze 4 days in a row, you’ll be presented with the date picker 4 times.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2017-04-06-15-48-47.jpeg)

Picking the number of days and dates with different ‘Ask for Input’ actions.

At this point, the workflow is inside a repeat loop and it knows which day has been picked. To create a single list for multiple days, we need to append lines of text to the same variable using the ‘Add to Variable’ action. Thus, before searching for events, the workflow creates a header for the day being analyzed that will act as a separator in the final text message. To make this more readable, I used a ‘Format Date’ action with a custom format string.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2017-04-06-15-46-30.jpeg)

Formatting dates in Workflow.

Now, it’s time for the repeat loop to look into your calendar and find events for the day being processed. For this, we need to use the ‘Find Calendar Events Where’ filter action, which will find all events that belong to the calendar you chose and that have a start date within the time range you entered. These events are sorted by start date (oldest first) and they’re counted with a subsequent ‘Count’ action.

The reason for counting events is simple: if the count equals 0, it means Workflow hasn’t found any events for Day `x` between, say, 6 PM and 11 PM. That means you have no scheduled appointments and you’re free to go out. If the count equals 0, a line that says “Free all evening” is appended to the aforementioned variable, the repeat loop is over, and the workflow can start processing the other day you’ve picked.

If the count isn’t 0, though, it means Workflow has found events within the selected time range, and it’s time to parse them. This is where I had to make some assumptions to simplify the workflow as much as possible. If events are found, the workflow calculates the following free times:

-   Free time between your ideal start time and the start date of the *first* event;
-   Free time between the end time of the *last* event and your ideal end time.

When I was creating the workflow, I assumed that, if you’re planning to go out, you don’t want to know about the 20 minutes you have free between one event and another in the same evening. You want to know when you have good chunks of time either before a late evening event, or after the last appointment of the day has passed and you can go out and meet with friends. It made more sense in my mind to find the time before the first event and after the last event ends.

Workflow has built-in support for the concept of “first” and “last” in a group of items. To find the first event among multiple ones, we just need to get the Magic Variable for the ‘Find Events’ action (remember, events were sorted by start date) and combine it with ‘Get Item from List: First Item’. To calculate the time between our going-out time and the event’s start time, we can use ‘Get Time Between Dates’ to extract the difference in minutes between the two points in time.

If the result of this calculation is 0, it means the event starts at the same time we’d like to go out, which means we’re busy. If the value is greater than 0, however, it means we have *some* free time between 6 PM (or whatever you picked) and until the first event starts. This information is appended to the ‘Free Times’ variable. A nice touch: if the value in minutes is over 90, the Workflow converts it to hours. It doesn’t make sense to tell someone “I have 180 minutes free”, so the workflow takes care of that as well.

The block of actions to find time between the last event’s end time and 11 PM is roughly the same as above. The only difference is that Workflow outputs a negative number if the event’s end time is before our preferred evening end time; I had to remove the minus sign with a simple ‘Replace Text’ action.

At the end of the repeat loop, two empty lines of text are added to the ‘Free Times’ variable as separators between days. Finally, a ‘Combine Text’ action joins every line of text from the Free Times variable, resulting in a complete text message from every day that was evaluated by the workflow to find free time slots in the evening. This text message is then passed to extensions so you can share it with friends using your favorite apps.

I had fun putting this together: Workflow abstracts much of the complexity traditionally involved with date calculations, and Magic Variables have been essential in helping me fetch data from actions inside the repeat loop as well as convert data between formats. This is a complex workflow, but it would have been much longer and more difficult to understand before [Workflow 1.7 and Magic Variables](https://www.macstories.net/ios/workflow-1-7-introduces-magic-variables-for-easier-more-powerful-visual-automation/).

If you’ve also been struggling to communicate your free times with friends, and if you would like a way to automate your calendar and see when you don’t have appointments in the evening, you should give this a try.

**Question:** Is there a way to create a multi-page PDF from images in my photo library? Right now I only get a single PDF with all the images. (Armando Carmona, [@armillio](http://twitter.com/armillio))

When you select multiple photos in Workflow and pass them to the ‘Make PDF’ action, the result should be a PDF with multiple pages, with an image on each page. The PDF can then be shared with other apps using extensions from the Quick Look preview.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2017-04-06-17-45-38.jpeg)

A PDF with images on multiple pages.

To put this together, all you need is to use ‘Select Photos’ with the Select Multiple toggle enabled, and then chain that action to ‘Make PDF’.

**Question:** I’d like to tap on an album in Apple Music and add it to a specific project in Todoist. (Dave Johnson, [@IndoorsDave](http://twitter.com/IndoorsDave))

The bad news, Dave, is that we can’t just tap on an album in Apple Music and run a workflow. The good news: this is possible with a slightly longer activation method.

There are two ways to run a workflow for a selected item in Apple Music:

1.  You can open an album’s dedicated page, tap the three-dot ‘More’ button, hit share, and choose the Workflow extension;
2.  You can long-press an album and select ‘Share Album’ from the contextual menu.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2017-04-06-17-45-38.jpeg)

Sharing an album from Apple Music.

That said, this workflow is fairly straightforward. The best way to create a task with information about the album is to turn an album’s link from Apple Music’s share dialog into an iTunes Product ID. The Product ID allows us to look up a *specific* item on iTunes and extract any piece of metadata we want from it. This can be done with built-in actions in Workflow with no need to manually call an API.

First, we need to make sure Workflow’s action extension gets one URL from the input. For reasons unknown, sometimes Apple Music likes to share two URLs for the same item at once, but we only need one. By combining ‘Get URLs from Input-Get Item from List-Expand URL’, we can obtain a single, non-shortened URL from Apple Music for the album we’ve selected.

Thankfully, the product ID is exposed directly in the iTunes URL of an album. We can use a simple regular expression with a capturing group to isolate the album’s ID and then look it up on iTunes with the ‘Search iTunes Store’ action. When this action is set to search by ID, it will return exactly one item – the product that matches the ID in the iTunes Store. In our case, that’d be the album we want to save as a task.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2017-04-06-17-51-31.jpeg)

iTunes metadata are extracted from an album as Magic Variables.

Using Magic Variables, we can assemble a Markdown link with multiple elements extracted from the album: the name of the album itself, the artist, and the link. These are three Magic Variables formatted in Markdown with a ‘Text’ action.

I chose Markdown formatting for the task because Todoist fully supports it. By putting a Markdown link in the Content field of the ‘Add Todoist Item’ action, we’ll create a task that is also a link that can be tapped to re-open the source webpage. Except in this case, tapping the task’s title in Todoist for iOS will directly open Apple Music, allowing you to start listening to the album right away.

I’ve kept the Todoist action intentionally blank, but, if you want, you can set a default project to save albums into, and also add a fixed due date in natural language or pick one manually with an ‘Ask When Run’ variable.

**Question:** Instagram recently launched a carousel feature where you can upload multiple photos in one post. One of the more interesting ways people have adopted this feature is to use it to “scroll” through a panorama. Do you know of a workflow that can take any panorama and crop it into several square images that align with each other so I don’t have to manually do this in Photoshop or Pixelmator? Thanks! (Colin, [@futurepixelfm](http://twitter.com/futurepixelfm))

That new Instagram feature is cool. Instead of Workflow, I suggest using an app called [Panols](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/panols/id1061408978?mt=8&at=11lbfL&ct=linked). The app scans your Photo Library for panoramic photos and displays just those. Pick one and it loads with a three-pane template that you can slide back and forth across the photo to get the crop you want. Tap export and the three square images are saved to a Panols folder in your Photo Library ready for adding to Instagram as a set. The end result looks great. For example, [here’s a scrollable Instagram panoramic photo that I took at the Colosseum](https://instagram.com/p/BSQrdFmAuBS/) last week. Currently Panols is available for free from within the [Apple Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-store/id375380948?mt=8&at=11lbfL&ct=linked) app.

Your weekly correspondence with the MacStories team.

**Question:** Is there an app, similar to [GoodNotes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/goodnotes-4-notes-pdf/id778658393?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_weekly), that ties well into API automation so that Trello, Toggl, and other input apps can add data to specific pages? (Snowflake)

The mix of note-taking and automation for individual pages is actually something I’ve been dreaming about as well – to be able to handwrite and have OCR’d text trigger an automation. Kind of like an automated notebook. I don’t think any app currently supports this, and it’s probably too niche a feature for a company to address with a standalone product, but it’s fun to imagine the possibility.

**Question:** I listen to MP3 and FLAC music a lot, but I’m using an iOS file manager and it is a nightmare! What are the best iOS apps to listen to and organize a lot of MP3/FLAC songs? (Jihad, [@iJihad](http://twitter.com/iJihad))

I don’t personally use it, but I’ve heard good things about [VOX for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vox-flac-music-player-with-mp3-youtube/id916215494?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_weekly). VOX lets you listen to music in a variety of lossless formats, including FLAC and ALAC, and it also lets you stream music from YouTube and SoundCloud. Plus, the app has a beautiful dark interface and it’s also on the Apple Watch.

**Question:** The latest Overcast seems to have removed a feature essential to my workflow. I have new episodes set to stream, because I have quite a backlog. Before going on a run (while still on Wi-Fi) I would swipe left and tap Download on the next 5 or 6 podcasts – and listen on the move. This swipe/download feature has gone, and it has been replaced with tap, tap “i”, tap the Download button, and swipe down to dismiss. Am I missing something, or is there a workaround? (Martin)

It’s not an ideal solution, but if you have an iPhone with 3D Touch, you can press on an episode and swipe the peek preview upwards to reveal a ‘Download’ button. This makes it somewhat faster to start downloads in Overcast. If the episode you press isn’t already in your episode list, you’ll need to do this twice – first choose ‘Add’ from the contextual peek actions, then swipe up again and choose ‘Download’.

**Question:** I have volunteered to find a better way for my daughter’s dance teacher to communicate with her students and parents. She currently uses group text messaging only, which drives me nuts. I’d love to find an app or suite of apps that would be a better replacement. She needs to communicate with different groups at different times. Many parents prefer a texting option (for whatever reason), so push-to-text as an option would be preferred. Bonuses if it can integrate with a calendar of some kind. What would be your recommendation? (Jason, [@jasonact](http://twitter.com/jasonact))

As someone whose girlfriend is a dance teacher who deals with groups of parents as well as other teachers in the same school, I fully understand the problem. My girlfriend is using WhatsApp to communicate with parents, and it’s not the best tool for the job.

I would recommend setting up a free Slack account and inviting everyone to join. Slack is available on every major platform (including the web), and it lets you create public and private channels for different groups of people in addition to private DM conversations. Plus, Slack integrates with other services including Dropbox (useful for, say, sharing videos and photos taken during classes) and Google Calendar. In this case, Slack could even be used as a public board to post status updates for everyone to see. I should probably tell Silvia to consider this as well.

**Question:** Do you have methods of managing contacts for those with multiple email accounts? iOS only allows one account to manage Contacts. I find it the weakest element – and frustrating for those trying to keep work and personal life separate. (Judi Jacobs, [@jljacobs356](http://twitter.com/jljacobs356))

If you’d like to keep separate address books associated with a personal email address and a work email address, one solution is to use the Contacts app’s Groups feature. Although Contacts’ settings require you to designate a default address book, it creates a different address book for each email address set up on your iOS device. Tapping the Groups button takes you to a list of the address books associated with each email address and you can switch between them to see just those associated with a personal or work email address.

Another solution would be to use an app like [FullContact](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fullcontact-address-book-contacts-manager/id579616837?mt=8&at=11lbfL&ct=linked), which has a tagging feature. Instead of dropping contacts into buckets based on email addresses, FullContact lets you keep everything in one database synced across all devices and accounts including iCloud, Google, and Microsoft Exchange. You could add a work or personal tag to each contact and then sort by that tag to quickly switch between the two types of contacts.

### [Wurps](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wurps-like-words-but-better/id1157673043?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_weekly)

We’ve seen plenty of stickers based on the idea of pre-composed text messages you can share as images in a conversation, but Wurps’ stickers have a lovely illustration style (many of them are hand-drawn) and they’re relevant to the times. The “whatevs” sticker is my favorite.

### [Handy Stickers](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/handy-stickers/id1201211252?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_weekly)

Why use characters with different expressions when hands can become the expressions themselves? These stickers feel like a combination of Apple’s Hands sticker pack and emoji – they’re cute and unique. I dig the 3D effect, too.

### [Gummy Monsters](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/gummy-monsters/id1219325042?uo=4&at=11lbfL&ct=linked&mt=8)

This brightly-colored mix of animated and static monsters shares a common excited look that livens up any conversation.

This is a small but fun pack of ten spikey black soot creatures. That there are stickers based on soot is a testament to the imagination of iMessage sticker artists.

## [Memoji](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/memoji-from-facetune/id1217420200?uo=4&at=11lbfL&ct=linked&mt=8)

Memoji detects faces in photos and turns them into emoji. There are 11 emoji to chose from, including ‘face with tears of joy,’ ‘smiling face with heart-eyes,’ and ‘smiling face with sunglasses.’ Pick a photo and an emoji and Memoji animates the face it detects overlaying emoji elements to complete the effect. The results are hilarious. When you’re finished, you can send your creations as GIFs, videos, or an image using the share sheet.

## [KAMI 2](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kami-2/id1133161444?uo=4&at=11lbfL&ct=linked&mt=8)

This puzzle game is absolutely gorgeous. Each puzzle is a series of colorful geometric shapes on paper with triangular shaped folds. You can change the color of an area by tapping it, which sets of a cascading series of animated folds in the paper that switch that area’s color. The goal is to change the screen to one color in the suggested number of moves. The puzzles were a little too easy at the beginning of the game but eventually became more challenging and even on the easy ones, it’s just fun to watch the animations.

## [Zones](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zones-for-training-with-exercise-intensity/id1139688415?uo=4&at=11lbfL&ct=linked&mt=8)

Zones is a workout tracking app with a bright, clean design. Each workout tracked is broken down by the minutes you spent in Warm Up, Fat Burn, Cardio, and Peak heart rate zones and includes other statistics. You can view recent workouts on a timeline, view data in one-week increments, or get insights into specific statistics such as weekly calories burned, top ten distances covered, or running pace. You can also create your own ‘insight’ filters. With an update this week, Zones’ companion Apple Watch app added SiriKit support so you can start a workout using Siri from your Watch.

## [FuelMate](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fuelmate/id521571828?uo=4&at=11lbfL&ct=linked&mt=8)

FuelMate is a logbook for tracking the fuel efficiency of your car. It supports multiple cars, can generate graphs showing your car’s fuel efficiency over time, and can export your data as a CSV file. You can also view your data from an Apple Watch. With the latest update, FuelMate has reduced data entry by letting you scan the price and fuel quantity straight from the gas pump. It’s a cool trick that takes some of the tedium out of the tracking process. Check out the Links section of in this issue for an article by the developer who explains how he pulled off the scanning feature.

## [Teletype](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/teletype-send-instant-telegrams/id1192998102?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_weekly)

Ever wished you could send a retro-styled message that looked like a telegram from your iPhone? This iMessage app lets you type messages the old-fashioned way – perfect for sending sarcastic messages to groups of friends, or to get in touch with parents and relatives who don’t fully understand modern technologies.

This new app by ThreeSea allows you to save web videos for later. There’s an extension to save videos from popular services (YouTube, Facebook, Vimeo, and more are supported), which you can watch later on the iPhone or Apple TV. I’d like to see an iPad version as well, though.

While Apple launched its Clips app yesterday with a native speech-to-text closed captioning feature, the folks at GIPHY went in a slightly different direction and built GIPHY Says, an app that turns your voice into an animated GIF. You can record a selfie video with the app, which will convert spoken words into a comic book-style message bubble embedded in the GIF itself. Clever and fun.

**Lawyers are always depicted as buried in paper, but from listening to Mac Power Users, you seem to work almost entirely paperless. What do you use to accomplish that?**

When I opened my own law practice I knew that I wanted to be paperless from the very start. I’ve seen too many colleagues overrun by their paper files to the extent where they dedicate hundreds of square feet of office space to filing cabinets, have to buy storage units, and it just becomes incredibly expensive and unmanageable.

The first step in my paperless practice is to generate as little paper as possible. The vast majority of my documents are never printed on paper. They’re saved to PDF or sent to clients electronically. On macOS and iOS, I use the PDFpen family of products for reading and editing PDFs. I store my documents in a series of files and folders on Dropbox and everything is backed up locally to encrypted drives using Carbon Copy Cloner and to the cloud using Backblaze.

I also have an entirely paperless billing practice. I thought I’d get some kickback from my clients on this, but turns out they love it. I track my time and generate invoices using Harvest. Invoices are all sent to clients electronically and about 75% of my clients pay me online using their Stripe integration. It’s a lot easier for me to get my bills out each month and I’m getting paid faster.

For the paper I do generate or that comes in my office, that’s all scanned by the Fujitsu ix500 ScanSnap scanner. I have a ScanSnap on each desk and everything is scanned immediately as it comes in. I find it’s important to stay on top of scanning. We scan documents and return originals to the clients on the spot. Everything else is scanned and shred.

Since all my documents are stored in Dropbox, I can access them from anywhere. I will still take courtesy copy printouts of documents to court for the judge or opposing counsel. But my “file” lives on my iPad.

**What was the toughest adjustment to transitioning to working for yourself?**

The hardest part was making the decision to do it. After a few weeks I quickly realized that it was the right decision and I’ve never looked back. I’m working harder now than I ever have before, but I’m also happier in my profession than I ever have been.

Day-to-day, not a lot has changed with my routine. I rent office space in a building with several other attorneys, and I keep regular office hours. So I’m still in a traditional office around other people. However, in addition to the legal work, I’m now taking on a lot more administrative, clerical, networking, and other duties.

**As a long-time user of Evernote, how do you feel about the recent redesign of the app and where would you like to see it go next?**

I still use Evernote, but I’ve scaled back my usage. Before I was using Evernote as a digital file cabinet for all my paperless filing of documents. I’ve now moved those types of files into a Dropbox-based file/folder system. This allows me to use Evernote for things it’s better suited for, like organizing random bits of information, managing personal projects and the like.

I think Evernote is starting to redeem itself and is heading in the right direction. I think future improvements would be making Evernote a better place to write text. Evernote is still a pretty poor note-taker.

**What is your home automation setup?**

Home automation is a work in progress. I love to tinker but right now I feel like we have such a mishmash of products with limited interoperability between companies that it’s all still a mess. When possible, I try to buy products that integrate with Apple’s HomeKit and Amazon’s Echo, but that’s not always possible. Currently, managing IoT products through Alexa is my preferred method.

My current home automation setup consists of:

-   Hue light bulbs - mainly lamps and outside receptacles
-   Belkin WeMo Switches - to control fans and similar devices
-   Ring Doorbell
-   Chamberlin MyQ Garage
-   Nest Thermostat

I’d still like to add a smart door lock and perhaps a security system, but am nervous and will probably stick with more traditional options for now.

**Do you think there’s any Apple product with signs of untapped potential?**

Siri is probably the product/service with the most room to grow. I’ve been an Amazon Echo user for over a year now and I find that the product brings me delight while Siri more often brings frustration. If I’m at home, I’ll always call out to Alexa rather than Siri.

I think there’s great potential for Siri if Apple will devote the time and resources. Given the Beats partnership and Apple Music, I think we’re likely to see a Siri-enabled speaker at some point in the future.

Friends of MacStories share their iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch Home screens.

**Row 1: Communication**

Besides the Phone app, the two messenger services I use most are present here: iMessage and Facebook Messenger. 95% of the people I chat with are using either one of these two services.

[Airmail](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/airmail-your-mail-with-you/id993160329?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_weekly) is, in my opinion, much more powerful than the regular Mail app. The syncing between all devices works very well for me. I like how custom folders can be used and managed in Airmail – it helps me save a lot of time when searching for an old message.

**Row 2: Organization**

Safari fits here since I use it very often for quickly checking some opening times, addresses, prices, etc.

[Timepage](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/timepage-calendar-by-moleskine/id989178902?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_weekly) gives me a much better overview than the regular Calendar app, where I always end up jumping around between dates just to get a better picture of the week ahead. The weather and driving time features are also convenient.

I use [YNAB](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ynab/id1010865877?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_weekly) for budgeting, though I’m still not sure if I like the changes in the new version.

[Idealist](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/idealist-shopping-list-grocery-list/id948435603?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_weekly) is there for all kinds of shopping lists, or other kinds of lists with repeating items. I tried many apps but I tend to stick with this one because it’s the easiest and fastest with just enough features. Plus, it looks good, and it’s also on the Apple Watch.

**Row 3: Reading**

[SZ-Zeitung](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/s%C3%BCddeutsche-zeitung-zeitungsapp-sz-plus/id448144025?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_weekly) is my newspaper app of choice, the German “Süddeutsche Zeitung” (in my personal opinion, the best newspaper in Germany). The app is solid, and it works just the way I would expect a digital newspaper to. It still reminds me a bit of the traditional and proven paper format, but with several extra digital conveniences.

In addition to Kindle, I like the summaries [Blinkist](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blinkist-nonfiction-book-notes-in-audio-text/id568839295?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_weekly) provides. The app offers enough depth to get an idea of a new topic or thought, but it’s not too long or time-consuming. I thought I would use its audio feature more, but I don’t like that I can’t take notes of the condensed texts while listening to them.

[Instapaper](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instapaper/id288545208?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_weekly) is the repository for everything on the web I want to read later.

**Row 4: Fun**

[Qobuz](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/qobuz-music/id946429340?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_weekly) is my music streaming service of choice. I tried many others, but in the end stayed with this small company from France. Its sound quality is better than most, and all the playlists and suggestions are made by humans. Qobuz’s recommendations don’t always fit my taste, but I discover more new music with it. Qobuz feels more like browsing in a record shop, with its own character and oddities, than the experience with other streaming services.

Radio.de. I love radio, especially talk and news/culture radio. This app contains all the German stations, as well as thousands from around the world. It is a dream come true for someone like me, who listened in his youth to shortwave radio stations from all over Europe and the world. I was incredibly happy when I was able to hear 10 minutes of a South-American station or an amateur broadcast from northern Germany.

I don’t play any games anymore except [Chess](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chess-play-learn/id329218549?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_weekly). And this app from [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/) is where most of my games are happening these days. In the app, you can also learn how to play better with all kinds of different exercises, read chess-related news, and watch videos. I’m still not a good player, but that’s more because of my lack of talent and time – in fact the possibilities of learning within this app are almost endless.

[Chess Tempo](http://chesstempo.com/) is one of the two online communities where I train with additional chess tactics. Right now I want to concentrate on certain types of them, and with Chess Tempo I can create custom sets of exercises.

**Row 5: Learning by Doing**

[Hipstamatic](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hipstamatic/id342115564?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_weekly) and [Filmborn](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/filmborn/id1052910024?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_weekly). My two photo apps of choice for the iPhone. Hipstamatic because of the many good and fun filters and its random mode; Filmborn because it offers a solid set of features (curves, rangefinder) and some beautiful filters which really look close to film. These two apps complement each other very well and I rarely use other photo editing apps on my phone. (For photos shot with the “big” cameras, I entirely rely on my Mac, with a setup consisting of [Capture One Pro](https://www.phaseone.com/en/Products/Software/Capture-One-Pro/Highlights.aspx), [Photo Mechanic](http://www.camerabits.com/), and [Alien Skin Exposure](https://www.alienskin.com/exposure/). But I use my iPhone and iPad as macro and shortcut centrals with [Quadro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quadro/id981457542?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_weekly), which is extremely useful.)

[LingQ](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lingq-learn-languages-french-chinese-russian/id379385811?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_weekly). I studied French for two years in school, but that was a long time ago. Now I try to refresh that knowledge and sooner or later I want to become somewhat fluent in the language. I enjoy the approach of LingQ, which relies very much on self-learning and attempting to understand, instead of just memorizing words and grammar rules. I listen to French podcasts and try to decipher them with the help of LingQ, which helps in getting a feeling for the language over time and not just acquiring some book-based knowledge.

[Streaks](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/streaks/id963034692?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_weekly). After trying several other apps for keeping and logging habits, I’ve decided to stay with this app for now. I like that Streaks is limited to just six habits; with all the other apps I usually entered too many habits and ultimately failed. The Apple Watch integration is great.

**Row 6: Note-taking**

[Evernote](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/evernote-stay-organized/id281796108?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_weekly). The big bucket for everything digital. Anything gets thrown in there. I love [DEVONthink](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/devonthink/id427575699?mt=12&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_weekly) on the Mac, but I miss the quick cloud-sharing features on my iPhone.

[WorkFlowy](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/workflowy/id551139514?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_weekly). I love taking notes of everything. WorkFlowy is one of the note-taking tools that just works. Additionally, my thinking process tends to be structured in outlines.

[Just Press Record](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/just-press-record/id1033342465?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_weekly). When I can’t type, but just want to remember something while on the go, I  use this app to record and transcribe short audio recordings. Most of the time I dictate them into my Apple Watch, and the recordings are later transcribed automatically on the iPhone. The transcription is not always super accurate, but since it also saves the audio recording, that’s good enough.

[Dragon Anywhere](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dragon-anywhere/id1024652126?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_weekly). It’s way too expensive, but I use it every day and *love* using it. For all kinds of longer texts, dictating is, for me, often quicker than typing. I usually have Day One notes opened in Dragon Anywhere where I dictate some personal observations during the day. The transcription is very good after some days of usage, and the service/app are adapting over time to my voice and unique kind of pronunciation. (90% of this text was dictated with this app.)

I hope that in a few months I will be able to replace Just Press Record and Dragon Anywhere with [this](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/835264493/senstone-the-intelligent-wearable-voice-recorder) – I am an early backer.

**Bottom Row - Most Used Apps**

[Day One](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/day-one-journal/id1044867788?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_weekly). My diary and general notebook. In the evening, I save the most important notes and observations from WorkFlowy, Evernote, and Dragon Anywhere – sometimes with comments or enhanced with pictures, further thoughts, and other notes. The most interesting newspaper articles or pieces of information of the day also have their own notebook here. I lost too many notes, physical and digital, over the last decades and so I don’t want to rely on just one service or app anymore. Therefore, Day One, Evernote, and WorkFlowy complement each other, and I don’t care if I end up with duplicate data.

[MemoFlowy](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/memoflowy/id1052582668?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_weekly) is just for quickly adding notes into WorkFlowy. The app is nothing special, but it’s useful when there’s not enough time to navigate around in Workflowy.

[Lifesum](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lifesum-inspiring-healthy-lifestyle-app/id286906691?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_weekly). I’m tracking nutrients and calories here, especially because I’m interested in their possible effect on my productivity and mood. In order to see some correlations and trends emerge over time, I use Lifesum’s data along with that of other apps in [exist.io](https://exist.io/).

[Taskmator](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/taskmator-taskpaper-client-reminders-task-to-do-list/id806250172?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l6nh&ct=ms_weekly). The home of my (TaskPaper-formatted) task list. Over the years I have used many – *too many* – to-do apps. In the end, I love the simplicity of having just some text files, and Taskmator helps quite nicely to manage them. I’m using a time management system with great success which is especially well-suited for the Taskpaper format – the first system I love and that I don’t have to adapt to my needs.
